<h1>COMMUNISTS AND ANTIFASCISTS JUDGED BY THE FASCIST LAW OF PARTIES IN SPAIN</h1>

<img src="..\foto\yolanda.jpg" width="261" height="324" align="left" hspace="15" alt="Yolanda Fernandez">

Nearly three years have passed since the start of the Euro-repressive campaign of November 2002 providing for the arrest and emprisonment in France and Spain of about twenty communists, antifascists and supporters of political prisoners. As PCE(r) militants, for the most part, of the committees for an International Red Aid or of the AFAPP, we are prosecuted in the judicial proceeding 36/02-M along with five GRAPO guerrillas.

<p>Twelve of us are still in prison without the National Court, a special tribunal inheritor of the franchist T.O.P., having yet fixed a date for the travesty of trial we are brought to. This is why, along with other exceptional measures, our <em>preventive detention</em> will be extended up to four years.

<p>As we already said in the declaration circulated on the occasion of the first anniversary of our detention, the sentence against us had been decided in advance. We have been arrested in accordance with the fascist Law of Parties and are in prison only because of our ideology and political activity in the labour and popular, antirepressive movement against the imperialistic war. Accordingly, the reason why we should be condemned is workers' right to organise their own party and struggle for true democratic freedom and socialism.

Our detentions, as the previous ones of November 2000 against the Leadership of PCE(r), took place within the framework of a 
<em>poisoning</em> media campaign and were described as a <em>dismemberment of the GRAPO</em>. However, only seven out of some thirty people arrested between 2000 and 2002 during different repressive operations belonged to this armed organisation. Also, their detentions were purposely carried out together with ours exclusively as an excuse for justifying the subsequent <em>illegalisation</em> of PCE(r) and its <em>surroundings</em>. After such a criminalising camapaign, we again fell into complete oblivion. This is a strategy we know exceedingly well for it had accompanied the Spanish communists' activity for three decades: what is not published in the disinformation media does not exist.

<p>Two years and a half passed before Garz&oacute;n prepared this case for trial: thousands of papers with false evidences and witnesses manufactured by the police (guardia civil). They discussed the contents of our documents and publications and created non-existent organic links with other antifascist organisations, etc. In spite of that, the trial is lacking in evidences: the famous <em>armed guard PCE(r)-GRAPO</em> was born thanks to Garz&oacute;n's work and will. None of the colleagues of the National Court had dared to create such a symbiosis between a political party and an armed organisation. As a result, during thirty years of sentences against PCE(r) and its militants, many of them were convicted of <em>illicit association and illegal propaganda</em>.

<p>In brief, our trial is a jumble that aims at hiding the fact that the chief objective of such a political-judicial bluff is the criminalisation of PCE(r). As a consequence, although the illegalisation of PCE(r) was enforced in March 2003 according to the 
Law of Parties, this Law was applied to us retroactively. The same had occurred when Franco, <em>once captured and disarmed the red army</em>, enforced his laws of political responsibilities retroactively in order to imprison and execute <em>reds and separatists</em> for their political and trade-union activities which were legal during the republican period.

Our trial is going to be held with the <em>social-GALosos</em> again in power, their mouths full of promises of a <em>democratic regeneration</em>. All of us do remember the result of past promises. Failing this, their present policy will remind it to us through the continuation of oligarchical plans trying to face the serious crisis stemming from their own capitalistic system. Among other things, these plans include rearmament in order to participate in the imperialistic war 
and the strengthening of measures of overexploitation and repression. The Zapatero(s), co-authors of the Law of parties who 
are going to send us to the dock, are the same who enforce this law to prosecute tens of militants of political, juvenile, social and cultural organisations of the <em>abertzale</em> left, or to decide which political alignement could be allowed to participate in the past autonomous Basque election. 

<p>Accordingly, in spite of their best efforts, they will never be able to conceal the fact that they are going to convict us as communists, antifascists and anti-imperialists. Not even the French collaborationist tribunal that judged <em>the Seven of Paris</em> succeeded in achieving this result: on that occasion it was obvious that nothing else was prosecuted but the right to maintain and spread revolutionary ideas. The political defence and the backing compaign provided by our comrades, including the assistance in the court from the internationalist solidarity, was a full political victory.

<p>Once again we need to stress this example of collective effort to mask the true reasons why we too are going to be prosecuted. We are asking for your most active and organised solidarity. WE MUST STOP THEM! We must overcome the fear of institutionalised terror and defend the legitimate right to organise just within their borgeois legality and in the defence of the true democratic liberties. As shown by historical experience, oligarchy yields only before the pressure of popular struggles. 

<p>We have been imprisoned and work together for a minimum of democratic achievements: 

<p>&#8594; Abolition of the Law of Parties and other repressive laws and special tribunals

<br>&#8594; Right of the nations oppressed by the Spanish Government to self-determination and independence

<br>&#8594; Full freedom to form and join political unions

<br>&#8594; General amnesty for all political prisoners

<br>&#8594; Release of those convicted of social charges

<br>&#8594; Right of asylum and citizenship for all refugees and immigrants

<br>&#8594; Exit of Spain from NATO and other imperialistic military organisations.
