<BR>Politic Report of the Central Committee presented by

<BR>September 1998</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We only have to pay attention to the situation in which Russia and the other former soviet republics have been left a few years after the establishment there of the capitalist paradise or "real capitalism" the poverty and destruction that this system has provoked in all orders of life, the deep abyss of desperation and demoralization in which the people's masses are, and the destiny of new wars and devastation that they are advocated to if they do not rise in time and do not rebel against the Mafia that has seized the power. The imperialists won't hesitate to promote the old revisionists in order to hold back the unavoidable revolutionary tide that is appearing in the countries that composed the former socialist field, specially in Russia. But the current situation is not the same as ten years ago; and the Ziuganov and company won't be able to contain much longer a working class that has learnt more in a few years of capitalism than in decades of revisionist dead calm.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[...] Nowadays, those ills -that seemed to have disappeared forever from Russia and other former socialist countries- are returning again, what unavoidably brings about the sharpening of the antagonisms and of the struggle of the masses to improve their situation and seize power again. This will take place rather sooner than later, since, unlike in other countries, those peoples, and, specially the working class, have known other forms of life, of work and of social organization much more just and of solidarity, much more superior to the capitalist form; and they know, by their own experience, the value of all that compared with what capitalism offers them, since, even taking into account the situation of backwardness and siege that imperialism imposed to them; even taking into account that this required a continuous effort and a modest way of life; even in the worst of the cases, they always could have the well-founded hope of reaching each time higher levels of wealthiness and freedom, having at the same time the enormous satisfaction and the pride of knowing themselves masters of their own destiny.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This perspective has not been eliminated </B>nor defeated, and it will not be possible to eliminate it ever, since, among other powerful reasons it is the most desired aspiration of all the exploited and oppressed, of the immense majority of the human gender that will struggle, as they have been doing to the present, to make it real. But those countries, specially <B>Russia and China</B>, due to their very historic circumstances, are <B>the ones that are in the best conditions to open it again. </B>It is true that history never repeats itself, and for that same reason neither can it march backwards; therefore, we are sure that its march forwards, the resumption of the path that it has already walked and in which it seems. to have stopped to take a breath after the big strides that it had to make impelled by the crisis and the imperialist wars, <B>will have to renew from those great countries and everything seems to indicate that it cannot be done from others.

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "red East" will still give very big surprises and frights to the capitalists, we can be sure about this. Asia has become again a place of big economic, politic and social tempests and earthquakes that are shaking the entire world. "The perspective is brilliant and the path a zig zag one", as the Chinese communists said very justly. <B>The centre of the world revolution, since the beginning of this century that is going to finish very soon, moved from the West to the East, to Russia and China mainly, and it is still placed in those regions </B>without appearing in<B> </B>sight anything in other areas of the world that could make us think about a new displacement before it had completed there its task. This seems to be the destiny that history has reserved to the working-class and other people's forces of those countries; what means, at the same time, a great responsibility that we, the revolutionary proletariat of the rest of the countries, specially of the Western countries, have to take into account, supporting them and providing them all the help that we are able to. This will redound in our own strengthening and will create the best conditions for the triumph of our own revolution. This reality imposes itself as a law established by the whole of the historic development and has to be admitted without any kind of reserve and prejudices. The "centrality" of the ultra-reactionary, imperialist West has long ago been superseded, since the monopolism, the parasitism and the Nazi-fascist, militarist and police regimes have ended up by depleting all their energies, any renewing impulse, any creation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new war that the imperialist circles are preparing will find the peoples of the East much better prepared than before to confront and defeat them, in spite of the torments which, without any doubt, the imperialists will inflict to them. On the other hand, the revolutionary forces of the imperialist countries, that grow slowly struggling in great difficulties in those true prisons called "democratic States", will also be able to find new support and moral stimulus in those countries, in their revolutionary peoples and in the brother communist parties.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from that, it is necessary to highlight that, nowadays, <B>given the weakness that affects the whole of the international communist and working-class movement, hardly could we find an "ally" or "assistant" of our movement more powerful and efficient than the very contradictions developing within the capitalist system, as well as the rivalries and the very imperialist war that they are preparing. </B>This seems to be another ineluctable law, although it is also true that those slaughters and disasters and big calamities that they provoke are not completely indispensable for the revolution to triumph. The question raised to us in this moment is that, in the same way as the revolution could not impede in similar previous circumstances the outbreak of the imperialist war of plundering, neither nowadays will it be able to impede it; therefore, <B>once again it will be the war the one that makes the revolution triumph.

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope that this time this will have a permanent character, that is to say, that the infernal circle in which the periods of peace are nothing but the preparation for a new world war, will be broken and the triumph of the socialist revolution in a whole<B> </B>series of countries will put the basis for a long-lasting peace between the countries and States that would impede the dark forces of the world reaction to launch the peoples against each other in a never-ending slaughter [...]
