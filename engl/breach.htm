<BR>number 14, November 1990</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although with less fuss than on other occasions, the Spanish politic police has mounted one of its well-known stalls to show the public the "booty" obtained in its recent anti-GRAPO operation: a couple of pistols here, a scanner there, some sleeping bags... Now they wait for the congratulations and the applauses; but of course these don't take place with so much intensity as on other occasions, they are heard on the quiet, without much enthusiasm and only to keep up appearances. The bigwigs are not happy. So much money spent, so many arguments and so many efforts, what for? They have not even been able to get their hands on Laureano!<A HREF="#n*"> (*)</a> No, they are not happy and they know very well why. We also know it and we are going to tell it to our readers. But before that, we think it is convenient to forestall an opinion that it is widely spread.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="../foto/mov-5.jpg" width=200 height=133 align="left">As it can be easily imagined -since this is not the first time that takes place- the news of the arrest of five militants of the GRAPO has come as a terrible shock on the heads of some weak and non-tempered people.<I> "When it seemed that the affairs of the guerrilla Organization started to run smoothly, we have to suffer the news of another disaster"</I>, a sympathiser complains; and he continues: <I>"Aren't you affected by the arrests?".</I> In situations like these, we can answer him, we are compelled to admit that it also affects us, at least to the same extent as the others; that is to say, we also are going through a lot although we don't show it. This is a natural and legitimate feeling. Now well, this does not impede us to admit that as long as the State and the revolutionary struggle against it exist, arrests and detentions will continue to take place; it will be necessary to make many sacrifices and we will not be able to avoid this even in the case that the functioning of the Organization and the conspiratory labour reach their maximum perfection. For this reason we tend to receive the news calmly, trying not to become hysterical, since only in that way will we be able to heal our wounds the sooner and to recover the necessary forces to continue the struggle. Within the Party this slogan was adopted long time ago jokingly: "Don't moan, each of us must face up to his own responsibilities!".

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last offensive of the GRAPO has got the big bosses of the regime very nervous. Their impotence against the movement of resistance has been revealed. They looked desperately for some success in the repression; they launched all their hounds to the streets; established checkpoints everywhere; combed entire neighbourhoods and cities, arresting anyone that they found "suspicious". We have news that they even took military the coal-mining areas of Le&oacute;n and Asturias. In fact, the situation is escaping their control and they have reasons to be afraid that one of these days an outburst of social unrest could take place. This situation has not essentially changed with the arrests of the GRAPO militants and can even be aggravated in the next months. The above mentioned arrests have taken place due to a lucky strike on the part of the police, since they even ignored which organization they had bumped into in the garage where they got the trails that led them to the commando; this proves that "our boys" were making a good job. Their main mistake was to have entrusted a delicate mission to one of the militants who, due to his youth, was not enough prepared for it. Then, they did not react in time, when it was evident that the owner of the garage -who was in fact the one who denounced them to the police- was suspicious about them. All the rest is well-known or can be easily imagined: investigations, trackings, controls, etc., awaiting to strike the blow to the highest possible number of members of the Organization. It is logical that the torturers try now to polish their dull operation, to confuse and even to spread trouble on the account of these arrests. Vain attempt.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On their part, the media also make what they can to spread confusion among the masses resorting to the old story of the "dark and mysterious" GRAPO. But if the GRAPO have never been a mystery for anybody in this country, nowadays they are less of a mystery. A hundred times "dismantled" in the last fifteen years and a hundred times organized again, their presence can be felt nowadays everywhere. There is not a single wall in the popular neighbourhoods of all the cities in which there is not a slogan in their support. Only this fact means a victory of an incalculable value and an enormous importance. The popular masses of our country had never before counted with an armed organization able to break -as the GRAPO are doing- "the monopoly of violence exerted by the State", able to defy the armed power of the finance oligarchy, to punish its numerous crimes, to strike it and to cause it so many damages and headaches. And this is only the beginning: with their armed struggle of resistance, the GRAPO are showing all the workers and revolutionaries the path that they must follow in the next battles; they are influencing the radicalization of all the popular struggles decisively; they are proving that it is possible to fight and to defeat the bourgeoisie following the strategy of the protracted people's war and the guerrilla struggle.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Party inspires and supports this struggle, we have always done it. We have supported the GRAPO since they made their appearance; in fact, we have always believed that they could stand their ground and develop as an independent armed Organization if they applied a just line of resistance that would not isolate them from the people's masses. We consider that in Spain there are favourable conditions for that. This is the fundamental reason that explains the fact that they are still there, struggling and shaking the consciences, in spite of the assassinations of many of their leaders and rank-and-file militants at the hands of the police, of the endless tortures, of the life sentences in isolation cells and of the black and yellow slobber that the experts of the media exude incessantly against them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How to explain this phenomenon? Of course, it would be too much to ask the government and the bourgeois publicists to enlighten a bit such "obscure" points. It is easy to understand that they are not ready to do that. However, we cannot separate in any moment the will to undertake and continue the revolutionary armed struggle (the appearance, the permanence and posterior development of the GRAPO) from the whole of the economic, social and politic conditions that made, and still make, them necessary in our society. In order to understand what we are saying here, we would have to refresh our memories about the period previous to 1975 and to compare it with the situation that takes place today in Spain. But we don't think that this is necessary. By that time, when the first arrests took place, the famous superintendent Conesa (who remembers such a bloody-thirsty idiot today?) assured -taking the opportunist organizations as reference- that very soon a series of splits would take place in our Party and that, as a consequence of them and of the continuous repressive action of the State, both the PCE(r) and the GRAPO would "dissolve" as a sugar cube in a glass of water. Now well, here is the result: fifteen years after, they still continue "dismantling" the GRAPO commandos. In fact, they have no reasons to congratulate.
