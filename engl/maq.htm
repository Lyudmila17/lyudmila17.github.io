<H1 style="font-size=32">A very "Macchiavellian" rabble</H1>

<H4>from Resistencia n&ordm; 54, Abril 2001</H4>

<P>The first important friction between our Party and the Preparatory Commission took place in June 1999, when they accused us of favouring "<I>the fractional work of the current CARC splitters ..."</I>, a group which has shown itself to be in disagreement with the constitution of this Commission and which had departed in order to set up their own stall. This vociferous reaction surprised us, since the only thing we had done was to send a letter to some people in the CARC precisely in order to place ourselves on the side of the Commission. Something was not functioning well in the heads of these people, but we continued to think that everything would continue to develop on the terrain of ideological differences, and that, perhaps, it was a problem which derived from the fact that the comrade who was at that time in charge of the relations with them was not able to make himself understood, and for this reason we changed the person responsible. 

<P>However, the real situation was very different, because the "responsible" comrade was one of those who then went on to form part of the shameful "trouble-making carbuncle", so that, as was then shown, the problem was that they got on very well, <I>feeding on each there’s mutual</I> <I>opportunism</I>. With hindsight, they continued with their relations, <B>hidden from the Party</B> <B>leadership and outside its discipline,</B> and, thus, it is no surprise that the neo-Trotskyists of <I>La Voce</I> were pressured into giving shelter and media cover to the trouble makers who, very possibly, would not have been able to carry on their treacherous campaign against the Party. Thus, it was clear that their earlier accusations that we were supporting "their" fraction were designed only to prepare an absurd justification for them to do the same afterwards with "our" faction. 

<P>Now, when they have been unmasked and are more and more isolated day by day, they deny the main point, that is to say they claim that they have not interfered in our "internal affairs" and that they do not support the "trouble makers". In a sense, they are right: the latter are in no way "internal", but rather were expelled ignominiously from our Party, which didn't stop the people on the Commission from continuing to publish the awful material they put out as a "Fraction", and in fact the libel that they put out was a carbon copy of <I>La Voce</I>. Do they intend, as well as tricking us and swindling us, to take us for idiots? 

<P>There is one detail which reveals the whole moral countenance of these "third-rate Machiavellian". One of their last claims was that we promised to give them X millions each year so they could "liberate" cadres operating in legality so that they could develop their [political] work on a "professional" basis. Naturally, we told them that they had to take into account that our scarce resources were furnished from the contributions of militants and sympathisers and, therefore, we could not offer them what they were asking for; besides, we added that our "cadres working in legality" were working all the hours in the day in order to earn a living and, then, they still had to dedicate time for political work, without this freeing them from to obligation to be "professional" [in these tasks]. Naturally, from this point, our relations "froze".
