<H1>Tortured: But In A 'Good Mood'!</H1>

<H4>David Garaboa Bonillo
<BR>Militant of the Communist Party of Spain (reconstituted)
<BR>Soto del Real. July 2005</H4>

I was arrested around 20:30 hours between the border of Port Bou (Girona) and France. After I was asked to produce my documentation, several national policemen took me to the police station were after refusing to identify myself with my real name I got hit several times in my face and kicked in my legs and one side. AS I started to bleed severely through my nose and mouth, they gave me toilet paper to clean myself and because I refused to do so, they started to rub it violently around my face. Later
on, appeared another police man in civilian clothes, who will later be the one who would lead the interrogation in Barcelona, in order for me identify myself started to hit me in the stomach and in the head. During one of those hits, his watch broke which was used as an excuse to give me another beating.

<P>After they changed the plastic tape which they used to hold my hands on my back for a pair of hand cuffs that they tightened brutally. They threw me on the ground facing upwards to step on my chest and stomach, a thing that provoked great pain on my wrists.

<P>Later they told me that they were going to take me to the Province Information Brigade police station in Barcelona and that if I was going to keep silent they were going to stop in the woodland of Girona and shoot me. While in the car they kept assaulting me and when we reached a poorly illuminated section of the leisure area of the motorway they made me step out of the car to <EM>take a walk around the woods were nobody would know what would happen</EM>. As I kept quite they pushed me violently back in the car and told me that once we get to Barcelona, their superiors will be asking them for <EM>quick results</EM>.

<P>Once in Barcelona, they put me in a cell and the ones who later will participate in the interrogations paraded before me. Amongst them, of course, <EM>the good police man</EM> offered to help me if I was going to talk. However the first three days on in communication were characterised for the physical torture: they hit and twisted my penis and testicles, they pulled my pubic hair and beard with latex cloves and so on.

<P>This time though, different from Port Bou, they were very careful of not leaving any marks on me. The threatening was also constant and assorted. They insisted that I would end up talking and added up that: <EM>if we need to use the bag, the vaulting horse or the electric trods then we will, and if we have to hang you by your balls from the ceiling we will also do it. You must be certain that you are not going to come out alive from here without telling us what you know, we have impunity. For the judge
