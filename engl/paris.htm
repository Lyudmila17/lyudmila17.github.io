<P ALIGN="justify">At Midday on November 8th, in Paris, the French police in collaboration with the Spanish Guardia Civil detained five militants of the Communist Party of Spain (reconstituted), Manuel P&eacute;rez Mart&iacute;nez (General Secretary), Isabel Llaquet Baldellou, Jose Antonio Pe&ntilde;a Quesada, Rosario Llobregat Moreno y Jose Luis Elipe L&oacute;pez, and two leaders of the GRAPO (First of October Antifascist Resistance Groups), Fernando Silva Sande y Victoria G&oacute;mez M&eacute;ndez.

<P ALIGN="justify">These detentions take place within the regime's new terrorist offensive, which has as its fundamental objective to prevent, using all means available, the vanguard organisations of the popular resistance being able to continue with their work of denouncing the regime and gaining greater support among the people.

<P ALIGN="justify">The anti-people and counter-revolutionary strategy of the Spanish fascist regime is nothing new, since it has been put into practice many times by the previous governments of the monarchy. It is sufficient to remember the dirty war of the Felipe Gonzalez period, through which they tried to find a "short-cut" to liquidate all resistance to the regime in a short space of time. As is known, this strategy ended up being a failure, rsulting in, on the one hand, the strengthening of the revolutionary organisation and guerrillas, and, on the other hand, an even greater deepening of the crisis of the regime and the political bankrupcy of the social-fascists of the PSOE.

<P ALIGN="justify">After the arrival of the Partido Popular in government, it was clear that this counter-revolutionary strategy would be applied, maintaining and deepening some measures of the previous period and adding other new ones. Now, prompted by the pressure of the latest actions of the guerrilla and the growing influence of the PCE(r) among the working and the popular masses, the setting into motion of this strategy has been accelerated. Thus, in addition to the suffocating police pressure which has been seen in the last months and the disproportionate sentences haded out to youths arrested for participating in acts of sabotage, they are now projects to reform the Penal Code and the Juvenile Law (in order to lower the penal age to 14), along with the re-establishment of life imprisonment for "terrorists". 

<P ALIGN="justify">The objective of all these legal reforms, which count on the support of all the parliamentary parties, consists in eliminating the last remnants of freedom of expression and of association, while at the same time giving carte blanche to the police and special tribunals (Audiencia Nacional) to repress any demonstration of sympathy or support for the organisations of the Resistance Movement. 

<P ALIGN="justify">As a necessary complement to these "legal" measures aimed at trying to isolate the revolutionary and popular organisation, there is no doubt that the regime will attempt to annihilate, using any methods it can, from assassination to arrest of militants wherever they find them (as in the case in Paris), to slow extermination of the political prisoners (the bourgeois propaganda media have already been put under pressure to proclaim that, after these arrests "it will be the prisoners who will take over the leadership of GRAPO (First of October Antifascist Resistance Groups)", citing among these <B>Francisco Brotons Beneyto</b>, in a clear attempt to confront the great solidarity that is building up in the campaign for his liberation). In addition to all this, there is the criminalisation of the solidarity organisations. 

<P ALIGN="justify">The "new" principle with respect to previous periods is that all these measures, as happened in the Franco era, are situated with the "legality" of the regime itself, making  even clearer still the return to Spanish "democracy" to its fascist origins, which in any case it had never abandoned, but merely covered up. 

<P style="color=maroon;text-align:center;font-weight:900">ONLY DENUNCIATION AND STRUGGLE CAN STOP THE FASCISTS' REPRESSION !!!

<P ALIGN="justify">We call on all popular and revolutionary organisations, on all anti-fascists and genuine democrats to express their solidarity in every way possible with the comrades arrested on November 8th, with the political prisoners and with the anti-fascist struggle in Spain. 

<P style="color=maroon;text-align:center;font-weight:900">STOP THE REPRESSION !!!

<P style="color=maroon;text-align:center;font-weight:900">FREEDOM FOR ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS !!!

<P ALIGN="justify">We thank in advance those who want to contribute and to help them confront the financial costs imposed by legal support of the people arrestedin France, as the French lawyers who are representing them have to be paid.
