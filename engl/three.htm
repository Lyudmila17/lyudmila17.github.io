On the Morning of Friday June 9th 2006, along with a large repressive display coordinated by the Civil Guard, agents of the National Police, Mossos d’Esquadra (Regional Catalan Police) and the local police in Reus,Tarragona arrested in this Catalan city, 3 members of the Communist Party Of Spain (reconstituted) PCE(r). These violent arrests were made as the Civil Guard blow up the front door of the house as screams and bangs were heard by neighbours.

<P>Those arrested were taken immediately to the Civil Guard Head Quarters in Madrid and held incommunicado, isolated from the outside world, unlawfully accused of belonging to the armed organisation GRAPO, a false accusation, such as many previous detentions, they are communist militants, whose only crime would be ‘illegal political association’.

These arrests are part of the tricky and lying politics that the Spanish State is developing. It talks about &lsquo;peace&rsquo;, &lsquo;dialog&rsquo;, &lsquo;the end of violence&rsquo;, but they keep arresting revolutionaries, torturing them in police detention centres, refusing to admit that the PCE(r) is a revolutionary working class communist party which DOES NOT carry out the armed struggle before or after in its 38 year history.

<P>They are lying when they say that these militants are GRAPO activists. They are lying when they say that they are involved in military actions. They are lying when the arrests, torture and life imprisonment of these three communists are sold to public opinion as a fight against &lsquo;armed terrorist violence&rsquo;.

<P>Understandably, we are very worried as to what will happen within the next five days that they will be held in isolation. The last PCE(r) militant arrested just a few months ago received a broken nose
