<TH style="text-align:right;background:black;color:teal;font-weight:900;font-size:12pt">Central Committee of the <BR>Communist Party of Spain (reconstituted)</th></TR></table>

<P ALIGN="justify">Last 9th November five members of the Central Committee of our Party, among them our Secretary General, Manuel P&eacute;rez Martinez, Arenas, were arrested in France. In this operation, which was led by the torturers of the civil guard, two militants of the GRAPO were also arrested.

<P ALIGN="justify">Hundreds of policemen were mobilized on both sides of the border to achieve the detention of this handful of prominent communists, some of whom had been evading repression from the underground and the exile for more than 15 years in order to continue with their tasks of leadership of the Party and of the whole Movement of Resistance out of the police pressure of the fascist regime.

<P ALIGN="justify">It is still soon to reach a definite conclusion as regards the ways that have allowed the bulldogs of the capital to find our comrades; all seems to indicate that the last movements of some members of the Organization Commission of the Central Committee aimed at giving a new boost to the work within our country have provided the Spanish and French police with the <I>"track"</I> that have led to the arrest of these comrades. 

<P ALIGN="justify">Anyway, in order to avoid any kind of speculation, we want to emphasize that the final cause that explains that they have been chased and finally arrested with such a deployment of forces is the fact that our Party has become little by little a serious political enemy of the regime. In the last years our Party has achieved important developments in its permanent task of education, organization and leadership among the masses, establishing closer links with the most advanced sectors of the working class and the worker and fighting youth, becoming in this way a point of reference for the whole Antifascist Resistance Movement.

<P ALIGN="justify">In this sense we can say that the comrades of the Leadership were developing well the tasks that the Party had entrusted them with, even risking their own personal security in benefit of their political activity and of the cause of socialism. On the contrary, the regime of the monopolies, immersed in a chronic weakness and isolation and with its 'left wing' sunk in the rottenness and discredit has engaged itself in a repressive escalation without precedents from Franco's time in a desperate attempt to stop the development of the people's and worker movement and of its vanguard organizations.

<P ALIGN="justify">Therefore, we have to consider this new blow of the fascists against our Party as a direct attack against the head of this movement, aimed at spreading confusion and demoralization within its ranks and to try to control it. This is not the first time that our Party suffers such important blows and we have prepared ourselves permanently for this in order to minimize their effects and make that they have the minimum repercussion in the development of the Movement and the Party. Following this line of action there are plans intended to replace the comrades that have been arrested and to incorporate new militants to posts of leadership.

<P ALIGN="justify">These plans are already being put into practice. At the same time we have taken the necessary measures of compartmentalization and security in order to avoid immediate new arrests. There are also general plans of work that must continue being carried out, adapting them to the new reality of war against the Party and the Movement of Resistance that has been declared by the PP government.

<P ALIGN="justify">Finally, we count with a whole political experience accumulated that is synthesised in our Political Line and in the Programme that will continue leading us in our trajectory of communists and revolutionaries because, and we must make this clear from the very beginning, no arrest, no assassination perpetrated by the regime, no pressure or blackmail, will deviate us from the course drawn up in the IV Congress of the Party and, in general, from the line of resistance that we have been practising for more than 25 years.

<P ALIGN="justify">We want to point out the responsibility that the French Rate and its government <I>"of the left"</i> have acquired with the imprisonment of people for g the mere fact of defending consistently their ideas of freedom and socialism, becoming in this way direct accomplices of the prosecution of a communist political organization.

<P ALIGN="justify">We have taken note of that and we hope that the example of this new outrage to the most essential liberties will serve all the true democrats to realize once more the true fascist character of the European <I>"democratic"</I> regimes, denouncing them as such and demanding the immediate end of the prosecution and imprisonment of the communists, patriots and revolutionaries.

<P ALIGN="justify">We call once more upon the people's masses, specially upon the working class in order not to tolerate this new attack of the torturers of the regime against the communists and antifascists. We cannot let the aznarists continue with impunity through the way of all-out terror: they will and they are already going for everybody and we have to stop them! It is necessary, then, to unite our forces to increase and continue the current struggle of resistance against the exploiter and terrorist plans of the regime. The workers and the most conscious and fighting youths must continue providing any kind of support to the Party and the revolutionary armed organizations, redoubling at the same time their efforts in favour of the release of our militants and all the political prisoners.

<P style="text-align:center;color:red">LET'S ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS !!!
<BR>FOR EACH OF THE COMMUNISTS IMPRISONED !!!
<BR>LET'S STOP TOGETHER THE FASCIST TERROR !!!
