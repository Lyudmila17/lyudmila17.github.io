<H1 style="font-size:26">Trotskyists and Saboteurs
<BR>The leaders of the CARC betray the task of rebuilding the Italian Communist Party</H1>

<H4>L. Carmona
<BR>from Resistencia n&ordm; 54, April 2001</H4>

<P>For some years, our Party has been paying special attention to the Committees of Support for the Resistance for Communism (CARC) which were attracting those people and organisations which were putting forward the task of rebuilding the Communist Party in Italy. However, in the end, their leaders, especially those of the so-called Preparatory Committee for the foundation congress of the &quot;(new) Italian Communist Party&quot;, have revealed themselves to be concealed Trotskyists, saboteurs and a scheming rabble.

<P>If we were to have to highlight the main problem which the European communist movement faces today, it would be the lack of communist vanguards capable of orienting and leading the workers movement in different countries. This is the main reason why our Party pays close attention when groups of communists proposing to rebuild the Communist Party appear in those countries, and why, within our modest possibilities, we lend them every kind of assistance.

<P>However, it is no surprise, given the state of confusion in which the international communist movement finds itself today, that people who want to &quot;fish in troubled waters&quot; should appear –or, in fact, be promoted by the political police themselves– who take advantage of our good faith and that of other honest communists in order to further their personal careers or to drive the movement that is still in its infancy down the road of defeat and liquidation. In this sense, the experience we have had with the crooks hidden behind the symbols of the CARC deserves to be looked at closely. For us, &quot;old hands&quot; in these matters, the damage that their murky schemes could do to us is zero; having already tried to sow confusion by supporting the &quot;troublesome carbuncle&quot; who tried to smuggle themselves in under the banner of our Party, now they have failed, they are trying again to direct their intrigues against the militants of our Party who are in Italy, militants who, in case there is any doubt, <B>can count on our total support </B>in their rapid and energetic reaction against the neo-Trotskyists of the &quot;Preparatory Commission&quot;.

<P>But these saboteurs have already done the main damage, to those Italian communists who were genuinely interested in the reconstruction of the party and who now find themselves in a situation where all the efforts of these years have led to trying to form a &quot;parliamentary group&quot; to support the &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the party through the means of ... &quot;the proceeds from state salaries&quot;; to state it openly: those on the &quot;Preparatory Commission&quot; want to live off handouts from the state. Despite this fiasco, we continue to think that the experience of these years and the role played by the CARC deserves to be looked at very closely, especially by the Italian communists, and that they will be able to extract the positive lessons in it and to work out at what moment it began to degenerate at the hands of a group of swindlers into a neo-Trotskyist movement.

<H2>The CARC movement</H2>

<P>From the middle of the 1980s in Italy, a group of intellectuals grouped around the Milan review <I>Rapporti Sociali</I> (Social Relations) had been carrying out interesting work analysing the experiences which the Italian and international communist movement had gone through in recent decades. Very soon, there was an exchange of correspondence between our Party and the editorial board of &quot;Rapporti&quot; which later gave rise to the mutual publication of material.

<P>We were already conscious at that time of the ideological differences which we had with them, and we never tried to cover them up; we said in the introduction to the pamphlet &quot;Texts for debate (II)&quot;: <I>&quot;Some points of focus and propositions in the writings reproduced here coincide with those which the Spanish communists have been making [...] Others, on the other hand, are divergent, as is the case with the characterisation of the current economic crisis or with the theory of two roads out of the crisis in those countries where the bourgeoisie and imperialism are intent on restoring capitalism. In any case, we are not going to elaborate here on our positions  in this regard; since the debate is necessary, there will be opportunities to return to these and other questions.&quot; </I>The successive works by our Party on the economic crisis, above all in the pamphlet entitled &quot;Absolute superconfusion of capital&quot;, were, for example, the product of this debate.

<P>In the meantime, the necessity of rebuilding the Italian Communist Party was accepted by an increasing number of communist individuals and organisations, in so far as the political crisis of the monopoly bourgeois State which emerged after WW2 was developing, in which the most advanced elements of the workers and peoples movement were drawing certain conclusions from the revisionist treason of Berlinguer and company and from the dead end that the militarism of the Red Brigades had them led to. In this way,  during the 1990s the CARC movement appeared, which very soon spread to the main Italian cities and succeeded in placing itself at the head of some struggles for certain demands, for example the unemployed of Naples, as well as some political struggles, like support for political prisoners and against the Italian intervention in the Balkan wars.

<P>This movement was very confused ideologically and dispersed organisationally; almost the only things which united them were the defence of a schematic &quot;Maoism&quot; and the necessity of the Party. Hence, our entire interest was centred on helping them to overcome this ideological and organisational paralysis and to confront the task of reconstructing the Party on the basis of a minimum degree of ideological coherence and to begin to work on the basis of democratic centralism. This was the period in which Arenas’ articles on &quot;Mass Line and the Marxist Theory of Knowledge&quot;, &quot;The Universal and the Particular&quot; and &quot;The Problem of Identity&quot; appeared in ANTORCHA.

<P>Following the thread of these articles, we thought that the determination of <I>Rapporti Sociali</I> to maintain that &quot;Maoism&quot; was a new <I>higher</I> phase or stage of Marxism-Leninism, or that it had <I>surperceded</I> Marxism-Leninism, together with other ideas related to it like their particular vision of &quot;the mass line&quot;, which was extremely biased towards &quot;practice&quot; [as opposed to theory], constituted a unity of disparate elements which could only result in the purest &quot;mass&quot; spontaneism and in the swamp of conciliation with the bourgeois enemy. In the face of these positions, we continued to think that, as stated in the article &quot;The trunk, the branches and the leaves&quot; published in ANTORCHA No. 5 (June 1999): &quot;Today, as yesterday, <B>no-one who is not Marxist-Leninist can be considered a communist</B>. This does not stop us, naturally, from being Maoists at the same time. What we cannot do is to sweep aside the principles of Marxism-Leninism and place them in a second or third level, throwing them out as things of the past, which have now been &quot;superceded&quot; by history and the practical experiences of the movement, since, without these principles, everything that we say, including about Maoism, will end up always being a substitute, a theory without solid foundations or simply hot air.&quot; Well, during all this time, the people concerned did not get the message of these critiques, and the discussions ended up with the usual protests about &quot;dogmatism&quot; or &quot;bad methods&quot;, a song which has certainly been sung lately by the &quot;trouble makers&quot; who have been expelled from our party.

<H2>The opportunists remove their mask</H2>

<P>Finally, at the end of the 1990s, a series of steps were taken within the CARC which seemed to be leading the movement towards the formation of a genuine Party, with the creation under clandestine conditions of what was called the &quot;Preparatory Commission (PC) of the Foundation Congress of the (new) Italian Communist Party&quot; which drew up a Draft Programme and started to produce the review <I>La Voce</I>. Despite the fact that we supported this initiative, the attempts made from our side to help to bring about ideological rapprochement failed again and again. Something &quot;smelt rotten&quot; in this determination to shy away from the most elementary debate and, following on from this, sooner or later the differences began to be converted into a real obstacle to the deepening of our relations.

<P>In effect, the past months have been full of &quot;mix-ups&quot;, as we called them, which can be can be summed up as a series of ridiculous proposals on the part of <I>La Voce</I> (for example for us to set up some &quot;offices&quot; in Germany or France for them &quot;in order to push forward the reconstruction of the Party&quot;) and an attempt on our part to sit down together to discuss things seriously. Even before the open support of PC for the bandits of &quot;the Faction&quot; had been confirmed, we had already in fact cut off relations with them, thinking that, at the least, practice would make them reconsider. The complete opposite was the case. Shortly after going off &quot;on their own&quot;, they revealed the real rightist nature which they had been hiding behind the mask of &quot;Maoism.&quot; Their call in <I>La Voce</I> &quot;to build the Front for the reconstruction of the communist party which will take part in the coming political elections,&quot; showed itself in the purest Trotskyist style: they present themselves as the most leftist of all, in order, in the end, to try  to get the movement to convert itself into an appendix of bourgeois politics.

<P>At last the opportunists show their true colours! What has been demonstrated is that <B>they never had any intention of rebuilding a Marxist-Leninist Party</B>, but rather they wanted to get the honest people of the movement involved, tricking them, in order to set up a reformist platform through which they could pursue their ambitions of finding a place for themselves within the system. In reality, the people on the Preparatory Commission <B>have sabotaged the rebuilding of the Italian Communist Party</B>, and they have to be treated accordingly.

<P>Now we can see why, throughout this time when there were relations between us, they  never &quot;learned&quot; anything: those in <I>La Voce</I> were not interested in anything more than taking advantage of the prestige of our Party in order to prosper in our shadow; they also used, and are still trying to use, the pretence of support for our prisoners as an &quot;introduction card&quot; in order to &quot;gatecrash&quot; (the Trots call it &quot;entryism&quot;) and to continue to boss people around in the revolutionary movement in Italy and in the European solidarity organisations. Well then, their game is up and the rabble-like nature of the politics of Preparatory Commission and the Proletarian Solidarity Association (ASP) must now be clear to the whole world. Anyone who wants to take the &quot;centrist&quot; path, that is to say who considers that our rupture with them is a matter which only concerns the PCE(r) and the CARC, and to try to &quot;have a foot in both camps&quot;, is, in reality, in agreement with their scheming and deserves our complete contempt. It is necessary to clearly denounce these people as Trotskyists and saboteurs! We have to isolate them completely! This is the best assistance we can lend at this time to the task of rebuilding the Italian Communist Party.
