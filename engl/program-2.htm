<H2><A NAME="c4"></a>4. Programme</H2>

The main characteristics and contradictions of our society can be deduced from the economic development reached, from the class structure and from the political nature of the regime that rules in Spain. Regarding this and as a summary of the exposition given above we can conclude that <B>Spain is a State monopolist capitalist country, where to the contradictions proper of this system we can add those derived from the establishment and the dominion of a regime of a fascist kind</B>.

<P>Fascism has been the main means that the landowning and finance oligarchy has used to submit the popular masses and to carry out the economic development of the country through the monopolist via. This double character, monopolist (imperialist) and at the same time fascist, is the main characteristic of the Spanish State.

<P>With the development of the big industry, the capitalist agriculture, the large-scale trade, the transports, etc., and with the merging of all the economic sectors with the bank and the State put at its service, the oligarchy has created the material conditions necessary for the realization of socialism; it has also made the proletariat grow and educates it in the school of the almost permanent civil war.

<P>According to the abovementioned general considerations, the pending revolution in Spain can only have a <B>socialist character</B>. In our country there is no intermediate revolutionary stage, no <EM>missing link in the historic chain</EM>, previous to the socialist revolution. Therefore, <B>the strategic objective pursued by the Party is the destruction of the fascist State, the expropriation of the finance-landowning oligarchy and the establishment of the People's Republic</B>.

<P>The proletariat is the most exploited and oppressed class, the best organized and the most revolutionary of the population and, due to that, besides being the class called <B>to lead</B> the other people's sectors, it constitutes <B>the main motor force</B> of the revolution. Together with the working class, the small peasants and many other workers and semiproletarians (small haulage contractors, employees, self-employed workers, etc.), the peoples of the oppressed nationalities and the progressive intellectuals can take an active part in the struggle for the overthrowing of capitalism or remain neutral.

<P>Among those sectors, the closest to the proletariat are the semiproletarians and small peasants who are charged with debts by the banks. In the perspective of their future interests, all those sectors are objectively interested in the socialist revolution although they hesitate continuously between the consistent democratic and revolutionary positions of the proletariat and the bourgeois reformism. <B>The tactics</B> of the Party seeks to attract them to the side of the proletariat, <B>with the aim of overthrowing the finance and landowning oligarchy by force and winning the petty bourgeoisie or trying to neutralize it</B>.

<P>The Party cannot aim at leading the working class directly from the present situation to the seizure of power. For this it is necessary to count with certain inner and external conditions, with a powerful organization and with many political experiences, both on the part of the masses and on that of the Party itself. All this will have to appear or will be created in the course of the revolutionary struggle and in <B>the very process of overthrowing of the capitalist regime</B>.

<P>With the establishment of the People's Republic a new period is opened which goes from the overthrowing of the fascist and imperialist State to the establishment of the <B>dictatorship of the proletariat</B>. This period covers a <B>short transition stage</B> that can also be considered as the <B>beginning of the socialist restructuring</B>, which will have to be presided by a <B>provisional government </B>acting as the organ of the ample masses of the people in arms. The main mission of this government will be to crush the violent opposition of the big bourgeoisie and other reactionary sectors and to guarantee the calling of really free elections to a <B>Constituent Assembly</B>. This Assembly will draw up a Constitution and will elect the new democratic government.

<P>The Programme of the Party for this stage of transition can be summarized in the following points:

<div style="color:maroon;font-weight:800;text-align:left;margin-left:40">

<P>1) Establishment of a Provisional Democratico-Revolutionary Government.

Only a revolutionary government formed by the representatives of the people's organizations acting as the organ of the victorious people's insurrection, will have the strength and authority necessary to organize the elections to an assembly of representatives of the people. Under the new government the complete demolition of the old bourgeois State machine will be carried out; the basis upon which the domination and the privileges of capital are built will be demolished from its foundations (since this is the first condition for any truly democratic and people's revolution); and all the economic and social transformations necessary will start immediately facilitating in this way the establishment of the people's power and, within it, the political hegemony of the proletariat.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

Any power that prides itself on being popular must be based on the people in arms and on the political organizations that are authentically democratic. The revolutionary masses will be able to defend their conquests and to exert control upon their Government organizing their own army and the militia and basing themselves on the political organs of power.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

The people's masses must be able to elect freely and to revoke, if it were necessary, their representatives. Councils will be elected in each factory, agricultural exploitation, military unit, teaching centre, town, city, district, etc. These will be the organs of decision and execution of the new power, with autonomy and authority to organize and lead any kind of social activities: from labour to sports and from the militia to the administration of justice.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

All the communist, independentist, anarchist, anti-militarist, anti-imperialist and antifascist prisoners will be immediately released. This is nowadays a deep aspiration which cannot be delayed. However, it will be necessary to make justice with the counter-revolutionary torturers and criminals. Those who had stood out in the repression will be arrested and exemplarily punished, which will be in charge of the People's Courts. This will not be done for a desire of revenge but for a political need since the reactionaries, even after the revolution, will still try to recover power and the lost privileges; for this reason, the revolution will have to defend itself from them, repressing and dissuading them.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

The revolution will carry out the nationalization of the fundamental means of production. It is not a question of expropriating the savings nor the small property legitimately acquired through the personal or family work and effort, such as the land of the small peasants and all those objects of personal or domestic use (like houses, cars, etc.). The new power will fit out the uninhabited houses for the homeless families and people. Besides, the nationalized capital and big companies will depend on the State and will be controlled by the Workers' and People's Councils or Committees. In this way, the workers will become the effective owners of the nationalized economy putting it at their own service.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

The principle of self-determination is a universally admitted right of the political democracy which the new State born out of the revolution in Spain must put into practice. In the shortest period of time possible, a referendum will be held so that the peoples of the nationalities will decide on their own if they wish to separate to establish a different State or if they want to remain united at a level of absolute economic, political and cultural equality. In any case, the new government, the political parties and the people's organizations will have to respect the decision freely expressed by the peoples of the nationalities and to facilitate the exercise of all their rights.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

The New People's Power will carry out the expropriation of the counter-revolutionaries, of all those who had actively collaborated with the counter-revolution, even if they are small owners. The rest, those who are on the people's side, will be helped by the State in an effective way through low or non-interest-bearing loans, paying just prices for their products, providing them with technical support, etc. These measures will be in accordance with the political and economic interests of the revolution.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

After the overthrowing of the oligarchy, the main means of printing, distribution, mass media, etc. will be controlled and managed by the people through their representative organizations. Only in this way can be secured the exercise of the right of expression and the right to a true and objective information, as well as to a truly democratic culture.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

As regards to the right of strike we must take into account that we will be in a transition stage in which a certain type of small and medium-size private property will still exist. Under these conditions the New People's Power will have to guarantee the rights of strike and demonstration both to prevent the unfair measures of the government and, mainly, to struggle against the arbitrariness which will unavoidably appear on the part of the small and middle industrialists.

<P><img src="../dibu/redstar.gif" width=20 height=16 align="absmiddle">

Together with the application of the principles of peaceful coexistence, the new State will give all its support to the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations and will give priority in its relations to the countries liberated from the imperialist yoke, strengthening the tides of friendship and cooperation. In this way, it will contribute to the cause of the world revolution isolating and weakening imperialism.

<H2><A NAME="c5"></a>5. Political line</H2>

<H3><A NAME="c51"></a>5.1 The main objective of the political action of the Party</H3>

The action of the Party and its political line will have to correspond, in any moment, to the immediate and future interests of the masses and take very much into account their aspirations, their state of mind and readiness for the struggle.

<P>When carrying out our general task, we have to take into account that the masses do not constitute a homogeneous whole since in them we can find different degrees of political consciousness and organization. We could say that the mass movement is formed by three main sectors. First, the syndical struggle of the workers, the protest and citizens' vindications and other kinds of sectorial struggles. At a higher level we find the groups and organizations which carry out the denounce of State terrorism, the solidarity with the political prisoners, the struggle against imperialism and militarism, etc., and which put forward several political demands to the Government. This can be described as the <EM>intermediate level</EM>, since it has a higher degree of political consciousness. Above this level we find the organized political movement of resistance; this movement <B>does not limit itself to the economic and social struggle, nor does it merely denounce the abuses and outrages of power</B>, but besides, <B>it aims at overthrowing it </B>and makes constant preparations in all fields to achieve it. This is the most conscious and best organized sector; it constitutes the vanguard and it is formed, mainly, by the Party and the guerrilla.

<P>In its greatest part, the working and people's movement <B>is not conscious of the need of overthrowing the capitalist State</B>, even if it is openly confronted to it and struggles against it. This situation imposes the Party the task of raising the level of political consciousness of the masses in order to make them assume its Programme and organize themselves to carry it out. With this aim we must, <B>before anything, link the most advanced sector to the leadership of the Party so that, leaning on it, we can attract the intermediate sector, raise the level of the most backward one and win both for the cause.

</B><P>This important task cannot be separated from the general struggle against the capitalist system and, in particular, from the political struggle. In this field the Party pursues today, as its main objective, <B>the political and social isolation of the regime</B> with the aim of being able to concentrate against it all the revolutionary forces in order to destroy it. With this aim it organizes and advocates for <B>the boycott to the State</B>, to its institutions and laws, to its electoral farces as well as to the parties and trade-unions that support it. In this sense, it is necessary to make clear that our boycott tactics obeys to the <B>nature of the political regime</B> of Spain. This is a <B>general</B> tactics, but the Party does not consider boycott a question of principle; and it cannot be discarded that under specific <B>political circumstances</B> we could advocate for the participation in the elections if this contributes to isolate fascism, and finally, to raise the revolutionary consciousness of the masses and to organize them for the struggle for the seizure of power.

<P>The Party does not recognize nor complies with the Constitution, which legalizes the monarchical fascist regime imposed by Franco and the Army and which establishes the system of capitalist exploitation and the national oppression. <B>The Party calls upon</B> the masses <B>to oppose this regime</B> in the most resolute way, <B>to organize </B>independently of it, <B>to spread the protest, the civil disobedience and to use all means of resistance</B>. At the same time as it organizes and encourages this movement, the Party must explain to all the workers the importance of the <B>struggle for the democratic rights and liberties</B> and, specially, <B>of the struggle against State terrorism</B>, against the special laws and courts of repression and against the systematic application of torture to the political detainees and prisoners.

<H3><A NAME="c52"></a>5.2 Strengthening the independent organization of the working class</H3>

The working class is more interested than any other sector of the population in taking the struggle against the capitalist State to its last consequences; and in fact, it has been acting for many years at the head of the people's movement as its authentic vanguard. But, for the proletariat to continue playing that role and leading the struggle to its end, it must <B>act united, as an independent political force, and lean on its own forces</B>.

<P>It is specially in the big factories that concentrate the largest, the most combative and best organized nuclei of the proletariat, where the Party must centre its forces promoting, wherever it is present, the most advanced forms of organization and methods of struggle which have already been tested or that have been created by the very mass movement.

<P>It is necessary to develop the independent syndical movement of the working class, organizing it <B>on the basis of assemblies and commissions of delegates</B> elected in them through democratic procedures in order to act united against the economic and social policy of the Government (against the restructuring, the reduction of the social security services, etc.) and against the extenuating paces of work, the degrading rules and other abuses of the employers.

<P>The economic struggles and those for immediate improvements for the workers are one of the most important forms that the class struggle adopts in the bourgeois society. The Party has the mission of organizing, heading and leading those struggles, since, besides counteracting the gradual empoverishment of the masses, they help to raise their consciousness and to organize them to end with the capitalist exploitation. For that reason, the Party encourages and helps the workers to create any kind of organizations (syndical, cultural, of self-defence, etc.).

<P>As automation is developed in the big companies and factories, the number of specialised workers diminishes and that of technics and cadres increases. This tendency to the growing separation between simple and complex labour and to the continuous wage hierarchy is opposed to the egalitarian aspirations that have always existed among the working class. In general, this sector of technics and cadres, in favourable periods, behaves as an alien caste to the working class and identifies itself with the regime of the bourgeoisie. But with the outbreak of the crisis it becomes conscious of its wage-earning condition and tends to confront the employers and their State. The Party must, above all, <B>attain to the vindications and claims of the most exploited workers, that are the immense majority</B>, developing among them the unitary organization and struggle, which will force that other sector to choose sides.

<H3><a name="c53"></a>5.3 Organizing the people's resistance movement</H3>

In the struggle against the bourgeoisie of each country, the working class can only count with the really unconditional help and support of the international revolutionary proletariat.

<P>Starting from this principle, <B>the PCE(r) advocates for the unity of all the people's forces and sectors which are opposed to fascism, monopolism and imperialism</B>; at the same time, it works actively to develop different kinds of collaboration with those sectors. In this field, experience has proved many times that unity is not reached by making <EM>pacts</EM> or <EM>alliances</EM> around the table and even less by making any political and ideological concessions for that reason. The necessary unity of the people's forces can only be reached <B>through the struggle</B>. In the first place, carrying out an independent struggle against the oligarchy and its State; but also, at the same time, denouncing the hesitations and inconsistencies of the democratic petty-bourgeoisie and other intermediate progressive forces.

<P>The hostility sometimes found in those sectors cannot discourage us in our determination. We have to be able to unite even with those who disagree with us since, on the contrary, what sense could it have to speak of unity? This does not exclude but implies the mutual criticism on all the aspects of the political activity.

<P>Among all the people's sectors that are opposed to the monopolies and to fascism we highlight the peasantry. The peasantry is one of the most exploited and oppressed sec
