<H2><A NAME="c30"></A>3. April 14th 1931</H2>

In the afternoon of April 14th, while in Madrid and other cities the masses celebrated the proclamation of the II Republic in an atmosphere of joy, half a hundred of militants of the Party, headed by their secretary general, approached the Royal Palace packed in a lorry shouting <EM>Long live the Soviets!</EM> and other revolutionary slogans. But when they got to Oriente Square an unexpected obstacle interposed on their way: the Civil Guard. The newly converted guardians of the Republic, who protected the monarch and his family until their exile, cut the way to the vehicle and arrested its occupants. In this way they saw frustrated their aim of lowering the monarchical flag that still waved in its usual pavilion, to substitute it for the red flag that they carried. In this way ended the symbolic attempt of <EM>seizing the Winter Palace</EM> by a handful of Spanish communists <A HREF="apronot.htm#n56">(56)</A>.

<P>Although anecdotic, this true and testimonial event shows the disorientation of the Party and its leaders in view of the events of April 14th.

<P>As a consequence of all this, the PCE isolated itself at that moment from the masses. In some places like Madrid, the communists that tried to hand out pamphlets or to address to the masses were booed and received with manifest hostility. Except in Seville, Bilbao and Barcelona, where its militants were able to drag some hundreds of workers to assault the jails forcing the liberation of the political prisoners, the activity of the Party hardly had any influence. It was in Seville, where the local organization kept the closest links with the working class, where its effective leadership was really felt, forcing the military authorities to proclaim during some days the state of war due to the violent demonstrations of the working masses and the assaults to monarchical centres and gunsmith's <A HREF="apronot.htm#n57">(57)</A>.

<P>The fact that the Party was so disoriented, launched misguided slogans mixing them with other just ones and did not understand the deep sense of the events that took place on April 14th and the following days was, to a great extent, a consequence of the wrong positions that its leaders maintained about the economic and social structure of our country and, therefore, about the character of the revolution. Since the leaders of the Party considered -as we have already seen- that Spain was a developed capitalist country, losing sight of the semifeudal features that still predominated in its economic basis, in the politic regime and in other instances of the superstructure, they had established as an immediate objective to carry out the socialist revolution. Hence, they did not see in the substitution of the Monarchy by the Republic nothing but a mere change of governmental facade and they launched the slogan <EM>Down with the bourgeois republic! Long live the proletarian revolution!</EM>.

<P>What did the Republic mean in the politic conditions of that time? Which should have been the conduct of the Party?

<P>In Spain, an industrially backward country, it was still not possible to think about an immediate and complete emancipation of the working class. Before that, revolution should go through a previous period of development and eliminate a series of politic, economic and cultural obstacles proper of the old regime. The Republic, in which the bourgeois character of the revolution was expressed, meant a historic advance with regard to Monarchy and gave the occasion of removing those obstacles from the path and of shortening that process. As Lenin said, the republican regime was <EM>the best form of State for the proletariat under capitalism. A wider, freer and more open form of class struggle and class oppression </EM>-he insisted-<EM> makes easier in huge proportions the mission of the proletariat in the struggle for the destruction of the classes in general</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n58">(58)</A>. At the same time, as Lenin also advised, it should not be forgotten that the State of the most democratic republic was nothing else but a machine for the oppression of one class by another.

<P>The very establishment of the Republic was, mainly, the result of the revolutionary mass struggle headed by the proletariat that all throughout 1930 weakened the old regime making its fall unavoidable.

<P>But, at that moment, the working class could not play the role of guide of the revolution. The politic and ideological influence that socialdemocracy and anarcho-syndicalism still had upon the working class impeded it. For this reason the leadership of the revolutionary process went to the hands of the bourgeoisie that, in this way, with the support of the repressive forces, was able to lead it according to its own interests and, finally, to stagnate it.

<P>By means of the provisional Government of the Republic constituted on the basis of the <EM>San Sebastian Pact</EM> -as in the case of the following one, formed by the republican-socialist coalition-, the big bourgeoisie, the landowning aristocracy and imperialism proposed themselves to undertake some reforms in order to contain the ascending revolutionary tide, using for that purpose the petty-bourgeois politicians and the bosses of socialdemocracy.

<P>For all those and other reasons it was evident then that the Monarchy and the Republic could not be equalled. The relations between the republican government and the masses were utterly different to those maintained with the previous monarchical governments that were hated by the people. The provisional Government, although fundamentally counter-revolutionary by all its political orientation -since it proposed itself to maintain and defend the interests and privileges of the oligarchic forces and reactionary castes-, was able to confound the masses to the point of being acclaimed by them as the government of the democratic revolution. This important difference between the Monarchy and the Republic had to be taken very much into account.

<P>Besides, there was another much more essential difference, as the CI pointed out, which the Party did not understand and that impeded it to head the masses in the struggle against the bourgeoisie: the fact that, notwithstanding the hopes in the bourgeois republic, the workers pursued revolutionary objectives and the fact that under the Republic they found better political conditions to achieve them. The abolition of the privileges of the aristocracy, the Church and the high-ranking civil servants, the agrarian reform, the improvement of the living and working conditions, the self-determination of the oppressed nationalities, etc. were still at the order of the day. It was there where the Party had its main battlefield to dispute the bourgeoisie its influence among the masses, since it was clear that those aspirations of the people would not take long to enter into an open conflict with the counter-revolutionary policy of the provisional Government and the other republican governments that would follow it. As the Leadership of the CI stated in its criticisms, the whole policy of the Party <EM>should be based on this divorce and inevitable conflict between the revolutionary will of the masses and the reactionary policy of the republican government and tend to provoke them. The Party, not underlining the reactionary policy of the republican government and denying the beginning of the democratic revolution, has not understood the dialectic process of its development, already begun from before April 14th, but considerably favoured by the proclamation of the republic that, even sowing democratic illusions among the masses, prepares at the same time their disillusionment and the awakening of their revolutionary action</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n59">(59)</A>.

<P>Since the leaders of the Party did not take all this into account, this explains the fact that they underestimated the need of the agrarian revolution as an essential form of the democratico-bourgeois revolution and that they neither paid attention to such an important problem of the revolution in our country as that of the nationalities oppressed by Spanish imperialism or that they focused it misguidedly.


<H3><A NAME="c31"></A>3.1 Pulling the plant does not make it grow faster</H3>

The CI will also accuse the Party of <EM>passivity</EM>, of carrying out an <EM>exclusively propagandist activity</EM> and of <EM>incapability to understand its leading role</EM> attributing it <EM>to its great numerical weakness, to the lack of links with the masses, to its sectarianism and to the lack of previous organization</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n60">(60)</A>. The CI would even criticise the Party more than once for not having become a Bolshevik party yet. This comparison would be made in a constant and abusive way. It is true that the Bolshevik experiences were valid and should be taken into account but some time was required before the communist parties matured and were in conditions to assimilate them. Besides, the Bolshevik Party had undergone its own process from the beginning of the century and there was no comparison possible.

<P>The fact that the PCE had still not overcome its propagandist stage could not be reduced to a question of number nor was it true that it was not linked to the masses. Neither could this stagnation be attributed, in this stage of development, to the <EM>sectarianism and the lack of previous organization</EM>, for which the Spanish communists were not the only responsible. Given its origin in two different groups, the great influence of the anarchist and socialdemocrat trends in the working class and the little time passed from its constitution, about which it cannot be said that the Leadership of the CI was not conscious -the CI itself pointed out that it was a <EM>young Party... that had come out of the anarcho-syndicalist and anarchist layers</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n61">(61)</A> (and also socialdemocrat ones, we could add to correct this slip)-, this stage could not be overcome from dust to dawn nor could the way out of it be forced.

<P>As we are pointing out, the construction of the Party required a prolonged period of labour among the masses, of accumulation of experiences and, mainly, of theoretical elaboration. And the latter was decisive since the maturing of a communist party is essentially linked to the development of its politic line. Therefore, the <EM>incapability</EM> of the Party to understand its leading role was not a question of <EM>masses</EM> but of politic line or, to be more precise, of having a just politic line. But, apparently, the leaders of the International did not take this <EM>detail</EM> into account when looking for the causes of the immaturity of the Party. For them, everything was reduced in the end to a question of number, to the point of comparing its development with the growth of the CNT and the UGT! <A HREF="apronot.htm#n62">(62)</A>. Had the leaders of the CI already forgotten the leninist thesis in which precisely was combated that confusion between the character and the tasks of a syndical organization (in this case, to be more precise, anarchist the first of them, namely, ultra-spontaneous; and socialdemocrat the second one) and those of a revolutionary worker party?

<P>Certainly, in these ideas was present the fear that the PCE became isolated from the masses but also the impatience for its quick development. This voluntariness, there is no doubt, answered partly to the fact that the leadership of the International took into account the possibility that in Spain a second edition of the October Revolution could take place; what was not completely dismissible by that time. But that impatience was leading the CI towards making serious mistakes as the one of inspiring a trade-unionist and socialdemocrat conception -which was in correspondence with other of its positions- as its repeated insistence on the electoral participation.

<P>The same voluntariness could be perceived in its reproaches to the Party for its keeping aside from the majority of the demanding struggles of the masses, for not leading the revolutionary political struggles of the working class and the peasants and for not having established soviets yet <A HREF="apronot.htm#n63">(63)</A>. However, it became evident that, in spite of the mistakes that the PCE had been making, the Party was making developments although -and this is true- following its own <EM>rhythm</EM>.

<P>Three months after the establishment of the Republic, in Seville the PCE was able to lead for the first time a revolutionary general strike of great importance, in which the unity of action upon the rank and file with the socialist and anarchist workers became effective, what was considered by the CI as a <EM>success</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n64">(64)</A>. But this strike would not be the only one. From that moment on, the Party led important worker strikes, mainly in Vizcaya and Asturias, and it begun to have an outstanding participation in some peasant struggles.

<P>All these progresses were highlighted in the IV Congress (March 1932). Hardly in one year the PCE ranks had gone from 1,500 militants to 11,756 which is a remarkable jump if we take into account that, by mid 1935, it counted with 19,200 militants. The same happened with the Communist Youth Union (UJCE) during the same period: it went from 400 militants to 6,000. The influence of the trade-unions linked to the Party also increased. The attendance to the Congress of 101 delegates of factories and trade-unions representing a sum of 100,000 workers was an evident proof of it. On the other hand, the social composition of the delegations attending to it was a clear sign of the class character of the Party and of its links with the masses and, in particular, with the working class: being 75% industrial and agricultural workers, 11.7% employees and 8.2% intellectuals and professionals <A HREF="apronot.htm#n65">(65)</A>.

<P>To sum up, a very positive balance although it did not fit in with the calculations of the CI.

<P>At the same time, the IV Congress made evident the weaknesses and lacks of the Party in all fields, especially in what concerned the elaboration of the politic line. As the International correctly pointed out, the PCE had not yet a <EM>just enough</EM> politic line <A HREF="apronot.htm#n66">(66)</A>. However, although this Congress did not represent the <EM>shift</EM> that the CI awaited for, it meant an advance in the clarification and comprehension of the tasks to be accomplished. In this way, when on August 10th 1932 the monarchical-fascist coup of general Sanjurjo takes place, the Party, independently of the mistakes committed, will play in Seville a first order role in its abortion, heading the masses and leading the armed resistance <A HREF="apronot.htm#n67">(67)</A>.

<P>Of course the leaders of the CI could not be insensible to these progresses and more than once they had to recognize that the Party had achieved <EM>undeniable politic and organizational successes</EM>, that its influence <EM>has increased and is still increasing</EM>. But the CI underestimated them and sifted them through its impatience since apparently such progresses only meant <EM>a drop of water in a furious sea</EM> (68). The fact is that the International did not understand that the development of the Party could not be forced. Or, as Mao said referring to the same problem in the CP of China, <EM>pulling the plant does not make it grow faster</EM> since in that way its roots are hurt and its growth affected. Only in this way, on the basis of its direct experience which necessarily and unavoidably entailed making mistakes and learning from them, could the PCE extend its influence, elaborate a just politic line and, definitely, develop. This was precisely the fundamental problem that in one way or other underlaid in the divergencies and confrontations of the Spanish communist leaders with the Leadership of the CI.

<P>Some of the criticisms made by the CI were on the right track but they were insufficient and even unilateral. It was not only necessary to frame the weaknesses, misunderstandings and mistakes of the Party within a stage of development but also, they could not be separated from some previous mistaken appreciations of the CI about the Spanish reality, from the disorienting task of some delegates as Humbert-Droz, nor of course, from the mistaken line that was followed in the construction of the Party. In any case, the responsibility for all these mistakes had to be shared.

<P>This, of course, did not exempt the Party and its leaders in particular from their own responsibility in so serious mistakes. Due to this the struggle between the two lines that was taking place from 1927, between the Spanish leaders and the Leadership of the CI and within the Party will end up, after the establishment of the Republic, with a second big ideological and political battle.


<H3><A NAME="c32"></A>3.2 Aggravation of the conflict with the Leadership of the CI</H3>

As we have already seen in the previous chapter, the leaders of the CI were for some time expressing the need to renew or change the leadership of the Spanish section without this meaning an intention of <EM>purging</EM> or expelling anyone from the Party. To that aim were addressed their repeated attempts of placing Maur&iacute;n at its head; these attempts never became effective in view of Maur&iacute;n's progressive decanting towards trotskism. But it will be mainly after the proclamation of the Republic, and as a consequence of the misunderstanding of Bullejos and his group of the character and the development of the revolution, when the CI will insist more resolutely on that renovation.

<P>Undoubtedly, in that aim, more than the suspiciousness towards the <EM>goods of independence</EM> of the Spanish leaders, influenced mainly the fear that the Party became isolated from the masses. Hence, before the IV Congress in which Bullejos was re-elected as secretary general, the CI fomented and impelled the promotion and co-optation to the Central Committee of cadres of a well-known prestige among the masses as Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az, Dolores Ibarruri, Mije, Hurtado, Uribe and others on which it will lean to carry out the struggle against the <EM>Bullejos group</EM> later on.

<P>To all this another worry was added: that the Spanish revolution, about which the CI did not stop underlining its <EM>great international importance</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n69">(69)</A>, would not pass from being an attempt due to the lack of a mature party, since its defeat necessarily had to have an impact on the international communist movement.

<P>These problems and worries, joined to its impatience, took the leadership of the CI to be more pendant of the activity of the Spanish communists and contributed to stress the tendency that its delegates had already manifested towards replacing the leaders of the national sections. This was one of the reasons for the more frequent conflicts and frictions with the leaders of the PCE during this period, especially after the arrival of Vitorio Codovila.

<P>The crisis will break out immediately after the frustrated coup d'&eacute;tat of general Sanjurjo. The reason why this took place at that moment and not before or after has much to do with the context in which it developed, characterized by the increase of the revolutionary struggle and the worsening of the politic and economic crisis.

<P>Both facts -the inner crisis of the Party and the coup- coincide with the start of a new wave of worker and peasant struggles, much stronger than the previous one that will not go unnoticed in Moscow: the XII Plenum of the EC of the CI (September 1932) will take very much into account that <EM>in Spain was taking place an impetuous advance of the mass movement with a tendency to develop in the form of people's insurrection</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n70">(70)</A>. This tendency was much more pronounced in the countryside, where in the large estate areas were taking place each time more frequent mass occupations of lands and local insurrections. This explains the support given to the coup by the landowning aristocracy and a minority sector of the financial oligarchy which was more linked to the first one.

<P>In fact, the revolutionary struggle of the masses on the one hand and the economic crisis on the other were sharpening the contradictions among the dominant classes. For this same reason the bourgeoisie, under the pressure of the peasantry and with the aim of containing in first place the revolution in the countryside, will take advantage of the failure of the coup to <EM>expropriate</EM>, through indemnifications, the <EM>Greatness of Spain</EM> (the landowning aristocracy) and to initiate an agrarian reform in a bourgeois way which was so necessary for the capitalist development at the <EM>expense</EM> of their allies; although, in reality the ones who will pay its cost in the end, getting into debt with the banks, would be the journeymen and poor peasants that had benefited from it.

<P>All these circumstances will provoke the anti-republican military coup and will finally hasten the confrontation of the <EM>Bullejos group</EM> with the leadership of the CI.

<P>What the PCE should do in such a situation had already been advised by the EC of the CI after April 14th, in view of the possibility of some monarchical putsch. <EM>Being inspired in the Bolshevik example in the struggle against Kornilof -the CI points out in its open Letter to the CC of the PCE in May 1931-, the communist party must, without ever supporting the government, fight with all the possible energies as an independent force but also as the revolutionary vanguard and guide of the masses against any counter-revolutionary plot, taking advantage of such occasions to arm the working masses and to conquer new positions for the proletariat and the peasant masses</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n71">(71)</A>.

<P>What did the leaders of the Party do? Instead of giving an impulse to the independent struggle of the proletariat, unmasking the republican-socialist Government as a tool of the bourgeois-landowner counter-revolution and calling the peasants to the seizure of the land, they merely launched the slogan <EM>in defence of the Republic</EM>. This slogan in that moment meant the same as calling the masses to support the Government of counter-revolution and to submit to bourgeoisie. They were led to this outcome by their misunderstanding of the character and development of the revolution and, of course, by their schematic interpretation of the banner of the worker and peasant government. Namely, in the same way as on April 14th that misunderstanding led them not to take into account the democratico-bourgeois phase and pose as an immediate objective the seizure of power by the proletariat, later, that same view led them to consider the democratico-bourgeois revolution as an objective in itself, separating it from the socialist revolution <A HREF="apronot.htm#n72">(72)</A>.

<P>The danger of a possible isolation of the Party from the masses caused by these positions was more than evident. Hence, the immediate and forceful reaction of the Leadership of the CI and of its delegation in Spain.

<P>In the first meeting of the Secretariat after the coup, the delegation, supported by two members of the Secretariat, accused Bullejos and his group of <EM>tyranny</EM> and of following a mistaken, opportunist and counter-revolutionary politic line, and required a <EM>self-criticism</EM> from them. On their part, Bullejos and other two members of the Secretariat accused the delegation of <EM>interference</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n73">(73)</A>. They used as most recent examples of this the destitution of the responsible of the secretariat of agitation and propaganda without taking their opinion into account and the fact that the delegation deliberately did not inform the Leadership of the Party about the syndical and organization theses till the moment of being presented to the IV Congress. In view of these evidences the accusations of <EM>tyranny</EM> addressed against Bullejos and his group could deserve little credibility.

<P>However, the criticism at the <EM>dirigiste</EM> methods of the delegation could not be compared with the criticism at the mistaken conceptions and their corresponding practices since it was opportunism what had to be mainly combated. Much less could it serve to cover the mistakes as Bullejos and his followers pretended. The posed problems demanded a discussion in depth, using for that an adequate method. But, far from this, the delegation not only did not make any self-critical assessment of its action but, since it did not take into account the tight relationship between unity and ideological struggle, it sharpened the confrontation with its defamatory remarks, impositions and new interferences. In this way, after a meeting of the Politic Bureau in which the majority of its members, in absence of the charged ones, had approved a resolution in which the delegation was made responsible for <EM>the situation of craziness in the leadership of the Party</EM>; and after reaching the agreement of calling the CC, in order to state <EM>all the process of the struggles that have taken place and the measures of any nature necessary to avoid their reappearance and make the labour of the leadership develop in the best conditions possible</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n74">(74)</A>, the following day, the Politic Bureau -evidently under the pressure of the delegation- agreed to <EM>separate Adame, Bullejos and Vega from all their posts in the Party</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n75">(75)</A>.

<P>That same day the delegation also issued to the Party a declaration with the aim of framing the divergencies from a politic and ideological point of view. According to it, all its labour was destined to help the PCE to become a truly communist party, to secure the politic line drew by the CI and to create a collective and unified leadership. Finally, the declaration came to the conclusion that the three mentioned leaders were carrying out a struggle <EM>against the policy of the CI, a struggle that attacks the fundamental principles of the CI</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n76">(76)</A>.

<P>And, in fact, it was that way. However, it is dubious that it was a <EM>conscious</EM> struggle against the principles of the CI. Nor even can we deduce from that refusal to the <EM>interferences</EM> of the delegation, carried out to its last consequences, that they questioned the role of the CI as leading centre of the world revolution. This idea possibly never crossed the mind of Bullejos and his group although it is true that, given the confronted positions, it was easy to think that this could take place. Anyway, the fundamental problem that was then posed did not lie as much in the opportunism of the positions maintained by Bullejos and other leaders nor in that kind of judgement of intentions that appears in the aforementioned declaration, as in the kind of <EM>support</EM> that the delegation was giving. Although it was not its intention, this <EM>support</EM> led to eliminate any sign of collective and really unified leadership, of initiative and ideological struggle, cutting from its roots any possibility for the Spanish communists to think by themselves. Hence, they tried to <EM>submit</EM> anyone that disagreed with the criteria of the CI whether he was right or wrong. In the end the task that the delegates had assigned themselves was reduced to that.

<P>For that reason and given the outstanding role that the delegation played in the conflict, and particularly, the one played by the Argentinian Vitorio Codovila, we are going to stop a little more in this problem and in what derived from it, since we think that it can contribute to clarify some aspects of the crisis a little more.


<H3><A NAME="c33"></A>3.3 Something more than interferences</H3>

This was not the first time that Bullejos and his group had a serious conflict with the delegates of the CI. One of the last ones had been with Humbert-Droz, whom the CI withdrew from Spain by the end of 1931 acceding to the demands of the Spanish leaders. This delegate -of whom Stalin had said that was a <EM>hypocrite opportunist</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n77">(77)</A>-, not only did whatever he wanted to within the Party during his stay in our country, taking advantage of the fact that Bullejos and other cadres were in jail, but he also tried to impose an opportunist line as the leadership of the International itself admitted later on. And he was precisely the <EM>advisor</EM> of the PCE during the previous and following months to April 14th! Hence, can one be surprised about the disorientation of the leaders of the PCE? It is strange that they were not even more disorientated.

<P>Undoubtedly, independently of the fact that the greatest part of the delegates were not opportunist as Humbert-Droz, hardly could they orientate the Party, no matter how resolute they were, when they knew nothing about our country, most of the times they did not even know our language. If, besides, they wanted to lead it without taking into consideration the opinion of the Leadership of the Party, the result could not be more harmful for the very development of the Party.

<P>To that respect it is convenient to refer now to the considerations made by Togliatti in his reports to Moscow about the delegates of the CI that were in Spain during the National Revolutionary War; and, to be more precise, to the considerations referring to Vitorio Codovila. <EM>I do not want to hide you my impression about the fact <EM>-writes Togliatti-</EM> that the responsibility for the wrong work of the centre corresponds to our &lsquo;advisors&rsquo;. In particular, it is necessary to convince L. (Vitorio Codovila) of the convenience of changing his own working methods radically. The Spanish comrades have grown, it is necessary to understand this and to leave them walk on their own feet, limiting ourselves to the role of &lsquo;advisors&rsquo;... This would give the comrades a greater sense of responsibility and would help them to work better...</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n78">(78)</A>.

<P>For this reason Togliatti will ask the EC of the CI to call them to order so that they <EM>did not disorientate the comrades leading them through a wrong path</EM> and stop <EM>considering themselves the &lsquo;masters&rsquo; of the party starting from the basis that the Spanish comrades are not worth at all and that they stop occupying their posts with the excuse of making things &lsquo;faster&rsquo; and &lsquo;better&rsquo;</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n79">(79)</A>.

<P>If this happened in 1937, when the Spanish leaders were -as Togliatti says- <EM>in conditions to lead the Party and even to lead it well</EM>, what would not have happened in 1932 with the leaders put on the spot and with Vitorio Codovila around; or even later during his permanence in our country till the war was highly developed.

<P>Of course, Togliatti was neither alien to those methods nor to the mistakes that the PCE was making under his influence at the moment when he wrote his reports. For this reason his considerations about what was right or wrong do not deserve any credit for us. Now well, this does not invalidate the testimonial value of his observations since in them are made evident not only the interferences to which the leaders of the PCE opposed, but also the conceptions that inspired them and that led to <EM>cut the roots</EM> of the development of the Party.

<P>The same was happening by that time within the CP of China, with the difference that Mao and his followers, contrary to Bullejos and his group, maintained a just line in front of the dogmatic conceptions of the Leadership of the CI. And they were proving it in practice, what allowed them to oppose these and other <EM>interferences</EM> with more authority and politic strength and enter into the roots of the problem. This, obviously, will not spare them from being called <EM>petty-bourgeois nationalists</EM> by the leaders of the CI and its delegates, label that, saving the distances, will be also applied to Bullejos and his followers <A HREF="apronot.htm#n80">(80)</A>.

<P>Of course, the origin of the problem was not in the delegates nor in their methods but in the line of construction of the Party applied by the Leadership of the CI regarding its national sections. That this was a general problem, not limited to the PCE and the CP of China is proved by the fact that the XII Plenum of the EC of the CI, coinciding precisely in the struggle against the <EM>Bullejos group</EM>, approved a resolution which stated the necessity of ending with the <EM>excessive centralism</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n81">(81)</A>. This was a sign that the Spanish communist leaders put on the spot were not very much on the wrong track in their opposition to the <EM>dirigiste</EM> methods of the delegation. These methods in the end were nothing but a flagrant infringement of the democratic centralism on which, according to the statutes, the relations among the leading organs of the International and the national sections should be based.

<P>This question was tackled again, judging by the resolution in which the VII Congress (July/August 1935) -whose minutes were never published- pronounced in favour of a <EM>modification of the functions of the Executive Committee</EM>, in the sense of a greater <EM>decentralization</EM> and <EM>autonomy</EM> of the national sections, in order to solve the tasks posed to them. In that resolution it was underlined besides, the need that the Executive Committee of the CI, when solving all the problems of the international working movement, <EM>based itself on the particular conditions and peculiarities of each country avoiding, as a general rule, to interfere directly with the inner organizational matters of the communist parties</EM> (82). This measure was apparently justified by the adoption of the People's Front tactics which could the applied not only to the capitalist and semifeudal countries, but also to the colonial and semi-colonial ones. To this respect, the CI started to take more into account, contrary to what was happening with the old tactics of the worker and peasant government, the diversity of conditions in each country and anything that made impossible the unification of tactics and strategies. Besides, this was more necessary each day in an international situation characterized by the rise of fascism and the withdrawal of the revolutionary movement which implied a more or less prolonged period of accumulation of forces and to pay more attention to the national conditions. Namely, a reality that was very different to the one that had made necessary the constitution of the CI in the middle of the revolutionary rise.

<P>However, all those resolutions were never applied, becoming mere good intentions and in the end the centralist inertia imposed. For this reason, since the problem was not faced from its roots and since more attention was not paid to the independent development of the national sections and to their respective revolutionary movements, the Leadership of the CI will have to resort to bureaucratic and overbearing measures more frequently each time in order not to see itself overwhelmed.


<H3><A NAME="c34"></A>3.4 The expulsion of the <EM>Bullejos group</EM></H3>

This is what would happen in the PCE. From the moment in which the Politic Bureau agreed to separate Bullejos, Adame and Vega from their posts in the Leadership of the Party, the delegation started a dynamics addressed to their expulsion and to the <EM>submission</EM> of the members of the Central Committee that were supporting them, to the point that the great majority of them had to make a corresponding <EM>self-criticism</EM> through the organs of the Party. To that was reduced, in fact, the <EM>Bolshevization campaign</EM> started later on against the <EM>bullejist sectarianism</EM>, without this meaning a real ideological struggle at any moment <A HREF="apronot.htm#n83">(83)</A>.

<P>According to these methods, the overall of the Party will stay as mere spectator all throughout the conflict; although, it is true that they were convinced that the CI could not be wrong given its powerful reasons and the one-sidedness with which they were presented. That is to say, the prestige and the weight of the International were imposed instead of the very convincement and understanding of the mistakes that the Party had made. This reason, together with the fact that the accused ones -contrary to what they were accused of- did not propose themselves to carry out a fractional task, explains why a leadership that had been seven years as such did not drag a single militant with it.

<P>It is very significant that the Secretariat of the CI, contrary to Codovila and other delegates, did not see in the <EM>Bullejos group</EM> a deliberate purpose of factioning the Party nor of questioning the International and even expected them to rectify their mistakes. Nothing else was it trying to achieve from some time ago through a patient labour since, although there were serious mistakes in their positions, there were also positive aspects in their labour that the CI should take into account. For this reason the Secretariat of the CI tried to recover them. Hence, the disparity of the methods applied by the delegation and the Leadership of the CI when dealing with the contradictions appeared and the attempt of the latter to look for an agreement or a solution of compromise. Besides, the danger of inner rupture of the Party -which was not dismissible given the influence of the positions of the leaders accused on the immense majority of the members of the CC- advised to resort more to convincement than to <EM>submission</EM>.

<P>And that was the criterion that the Secretariat of the CI adopted at the beginning. After prolonged discussions in Moscow with Bullejos, Adame, Vega and Trilla -this latter being the representative of the PCE in the leading instances of the International-, the four of them accepted its proposals: Adame would incorporate to the Red Syndical International (Profintern); Trilla would continue to occupy its post of delegate; Vega would enter the High Military Academy in Moscow and Bullejos would reinstate to the Secretariat General, proposal that, at his request, was changed by the one of organizing the Party in Catalonia taking part of the Politic Bureau <A HREF="apronot.htm#n84">(84)</A>. But, after these agreements, the publication in <EM>Frente Rojo</EM> (Red Front) -voice of the Party- of the resolution of the Politic Bureau of October 5th, in which it was made effective the measure of separating them definitively from the leadership and of demanding them a public self-criticism in order to stay within the Party, was enough to make all the patient efforts of the Secretariat of the CI fall through. In view of such conditions -consented or known by the CI in order not to undermine the authority of its true inspirer, the delegation- the four rejected any agreement fully <A HREF="apronot.htm#n85">(85)</A>.

<P>The expulsion then became unavoidable. Some days later the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the CI and the International Commission of Control adopted the decision of excluding Bullejos, Trilla, Adame and Vega from the International and from the PCE. This measure would be corroborated by the new leadership of the Party <A HREF="apronot.htm#n86">(86)</A>.

<P>Could such an expeditious solution of the crisis have been avoided if they had gone to the bottom of the problems and they had adopted more just methods putting more emphasis in the ideological struggle and in a true criticism and self-criticism? We think so. But, even independently of the fact that it had not been that way, the Party would have been more strengthened in its unity and inner cohesion and, above all, much more clarified. The latter return of Trilla and Vega is a proof that, at least in some case, the expulsion could have been avoided.

<P>After the expulsion of Bullejos and his group, Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az, a worker from Seville who was in prison at that moment, was elected as Secretary General. There is no doubt that his election was determined by the outstanding role that he was playing at the head of the organization of the Party in Seville and Andalusia. Together with him, Hurtado, Mije, Jes&uacute;s Hern&aacute;ndez, Dolores Ibarruri, Vicente Uribe and Pedro Checa were, among others, the ones to be in charge of the main responsibilities.

<P>It starts in this way under his leadership a new stage in the life of the PCE and its <EM>true communist action</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n87">(87)</A>. With this we can say that it culminates the initial period of the construction of the Party -eleven years in total- during which there were established links with the masses, marxism-leninism and the idea of the necessity of a worker revolutionary party were spread among the proletariat and in the difficulties of the struggle were forged the cadres that at that moment took the reins of the Party in their hands.


<H2><A NAME="c40"></A>4. October 1934: a turn of the situation</H2>

At the same time that the Party decides on the conflict with the <EM>Bullejos group</EM>, the wave of the mass revolutionary struggle does not stop growing all throughout Spain and enters a new phase. This wave will culminate in June in the peasant general strike and, above all, in the insurrectional movement of October 1934. The deception of the workers in view of the counter-revolutionary labour of the republican-socialist Government, of the many killings perpetrated under its mandate at the hands of the repressive forces and of the increase of unemployment, hunger and poverty pushed the workers and, mainly, the journeymen and poor peasants towards a spontaneous struggle, each time more radical, for bread, land and freedom.

<P>Between the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, not a single region of the country was left aside from this revolutionary tide that in many cases ended in insurrectional actions. With these struggles the workers made evident that they were not willing to bear for a long time the conditions to which they were submitted. This fact fully confirmed the appreciation made by the XII Plenum of the EC of the CI that <EM>in Spain it was taking place an impetuous advance of the mass movement with a tendency towards developing in the form of people's insurrection</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n88">(88)</A>.

<P>Both the socialist and UGT leaders and the anarcho-syndicalist ones were each time more overwhelmed by their rank and file. All throughout the country, specially in the most combative working zones, the unity of action among workers of different tendencies was becoming a reality.

<P>To this phenomenon of radicalization and polarization of forces, the urban petty bourgeoisie was not alien. Ample sectors of this petty bourgeoisie affected by the economic crisis and disillusioned with the republican parties for their policy of compliance with the most reactionary forces, became more radical and, although with hesitations, they tended to go over to the revolutionary field dragged by the proletariat. As the Party pointed out, the deepening of the revolutionary crisis was making a clearer delimitation between the revolutionary field and the counter-revolutionary one.

<P>Apart from the world economic crisis, other international factors such as the raise of fascism after Hitler's coming to power in Germany and the sharpening of the inter-imperialist antagonisms also contributed to the development of this situation.

<P>The fact that the inner crisis of the PCE coincided with the ascending course of revolution was not a coincidence, but it corresponded to the very requirements of the class struggle that could not postpone the construction of a true communist party to lead the revolutionary movement. To reach this objective was essential in a moment in which the most extreme reaction was being organized and won positions threatening with seizing power before the majority of the working class could entirely assume the communist programme.

<P>According to the PB in order to place the Party in conditions of heading and leading the revolutionary movement it was necessary a <EM>shift of the Party towards the masses, which had been approved by the IV Congress (Seville) but had not been put into practice in and fields without exceptio
