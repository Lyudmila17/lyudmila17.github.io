<H1>Further deterioration of the health &amp; the kidnapping
<BR>of the PCE(r) militant Josefina Garcia Aranburu</H1>

Josefina Garc&iacute;a Aramburu’s medical situation has again deteriorated, as her heart condition is now accompanied with a &lsquo;slipped disc&rsquo; brought on by the rough way she was treated during a courtroom appearance in Paris during which she was brutally kicked-out several times, a violent act carried out by police that sprained one of her arms, over the period of a recent trail.

<P>On September 5th at the National Audience (Supreme Court) in Madrid, during an appeal trial regarding her freedom which had been previously denied by both Judges Garz&oacute;n and Marlaska. The public prosecutor asked for her to remain in prison because &lsquo;she had not given herself up voluntarely to the authorities but instead they had to ask for her extradition to France&rsquo;. But &lsquo;Mr. Public Attorney&rsquo; forgets that once she did her time in French jails, she was not released but extradited to a Spanish prison, where she still remained until she was hospitalised a several weeks ago, making this an &lsquo;unlawful kidnapping&rsquo;. He also noted that &lsquo;there was a risk of her escaping and joining the clandestine struggle&rsquo;.


<P>It was at that time, Josefina’s lawyer reminded him that she was hospitalised recently after having suffered three serious angina attacks and that an escape was &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; as in fact &lsquo;she couldn’t even get up of her bed&lsquo;. He described Josefina’s situation as totally out of proportion, a situation that he had never seen before even during Franco times, and that it lacked of any legal backing within &lsquo;Spanish Law&rsquo; as Josefina had completed her sentence as stated in her trial paperwork.

<P>Josefina was admitted in the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Madrid on August 14th coming from Alcal&aacute;-Meco prison after having suffered three severe angina attacks on a row prompting a high risk of developing a heart attack.

<P>Josefina is a true hostage of the Spanish System and an &lsquo;offence&rsquo; that she has already done time for. Therefore her situation becomes a nothing more than a kidnapping of a person with a very serious illness. Ironically her kidnappers are nowadays talking about peace and tolerance.

<P>Josefina was a political prisoner in Spanish jails for 20 years where she was brutally tortured for her militancy in the GRAPO. Following her release from the prison system she rejoined the political struggle within the ranks of the underground PCE(r) militant. She was arrested again in 2002 in Paris and went to trial in France where she was also tortured. After doing time there, she was illegally extradited to Spain where she has no pending charges. She has been kidnapped for &lsquo;offences&rsquo; <span>That she has already done time for!</span>

<P>This is the terrible situation: more than 24 years of prison, with a destroyed health, and a completed sentence without pending charges.

<P>To silence the extreme seriousness of her situation means collaboration with the State’s dirty war of annihilation of political prisoners.
