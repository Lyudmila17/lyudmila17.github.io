<H2><A NAME="c60"></A>6. The coup of Casado and the collapse of the Republic</H2>

<H3><A NAME="c61"></A>6.1 The defence of Madrid</H3>

In order to confront the rising, it was necessary to count with the people as a decisive military factor since a mere regular army, no matter how many progresses were made in its organization, would not be able to defeat the fascist military forces. This would become evident very soon in the defence of Madrid as well as in the first huge offensives and counteroffensives launched by the republican forces.

<P>Madrid, as the politic centre of the Republic, was the strategic objective of the risen up and to its seizure they subordinated their operative plans from the very beginning of the war. In early November 1936, after having culminated the victorious advance of their troops in Extremadura, the basin of the river Tajo and Guip&uacute;zcoa, the fascist high command was confident regarding the immediate seizure of the capital. With that aim they concentrated their best and stronger troops: the Legion and the Moroccan colonial troops (the Tercio), the forces of general Mola and the biggest part of their artillery and air forces, mainly integrated at that moment by German, Italian and Portuguese flights.

<P>In front of such powerful forces, neither the Government nor the career officers nor any party but the communists had any trust in the resistance of Madrid. However, Madrid resisted thanks to the fact that the Communist Party, with the help of the 5th Regiment, mobilized and organized all the people in its defence. The slogan <EM>No pasar&aacute;n</EM> (<EM>They shall not pass</EM>) launched by the Party, became the banner of struggle of the people's movement.

<P>General Rojo, by then Lieutenant-Colonel and chief of the Madrid Defence Head Quarter (quickly formed on November 6th, on the eve of the first attack), would say some years later: <EM>Madrid wanted to fight: it lacked weapons, organization, fortresses, bunkers, chiefs, technique; on the contrary, it counted with an abundant and excited moral, with little chiefs and with a citizen mass ready to fulfil its historic task at the cost of any sacrifice necessary </EM>[...]<EM> The change was tremendous: it seemed as if when the Government fled to Valencia taking with it the layer of pessimism and lack of confidence that covered everything, this had brought to light a truth till then asleep in the popular deep down, a spirit of struggle till then ignored, and this was the biggest force that we had in our hands because it represented the collective will of defence supported by a moral force that did not stop in front of sacrifice</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n133">(133)</A>.

<P>In the defence of Madrid also participated, apart from other anarchist and socialist forces, militia columns arrived from Catalonia, as the one commanded by the anarchist leader Durruti and the one organized by the PSUC, as well as the first units of the International Brigades.

<P>In order to yield the resistance of its defenders, the fascist army, advised by German military experts, subjected the city to intense indiscriminate bombings which provoked innumerable victims among the population.

<P>Although the combats for Madrid continued, the failure of this first attempt meant for the reactionary forces their first big military defeat after the one that the people's masses had inflicted them in the revolutionary journeys of July and it meant a great moral and politic victory for the Republic. For that reason, the defence of Madrid became the symbol of the people's resistance against fascism, even beyond our borders. Besides, if some lesson could be learnt from this heroic deed it was the great importance, as a decisive and determining factor, of the revolutionary and active support of the ample people's masses and their necessary contribution to the tasks of the war.

<P>This great victory had also its politic consequences. On the one hand, it proved the workers and all the parties that it was possible to resist and defeat the fascist army and the international forces that supported it, it strengthened the combative unity of the people's forces and increased the prestige and influence of the Party among the masses; but, on the other hand, it unleashed the antagonism and hostility of the leaders of the democratico-bourgeois parties, of the socialdemocrats and of the FAI against the communists, fearing their growing influence and that they could impose their hegemony.

<P>From February 1937 on, in view of the successive failures to seize Madrid, the fascist high command changed its tactics: it passed from frontal attacks to carrying out encircling offensive operations around river Jarama (at the beginning of that month) and around Guadalajara (in the second week of March).

<P>Both were disrupted by the republican counteroffensives, supported by an important deployment of tanks and aircraft which was possible thanks to the arrival of Soviet equipment and military techniques. The most decisive counteroffensive was the one that gave name to the battle of Guadalajara where, for the first time, the republicans defeated in an open battlefield a big enemy force much more superior in number of men and weapons as the one of the Expeditionary Corps sent to Spain by Mussolini. For that reason this military, politic and moral republican victory, to which contributed two international brigades in which several hundreds of Italian antifascists were posted, had so much international resonance and repercussion.

<P>But these counteroffensives and victories in which the progresses made by the people's forces in the dominion of the military art and technique were made evident, also revealed, at the same time, their weaknesses. Both in the battle of Jarama and in the one of Guadalajara, in spite of the heroism wasted, the republican army could not exploit in depth its offensive manoeuvres due to their deficient leadership, to the underestimation of the enemy forces, to the lack of experience, to the absence of reinforcements and to the tremendous losses suffered. But, above all, due to the numerical superiority of the enemy. For these reasons the republican forces, after their advance, were forced to withdraw later on to their initial positions and to adopt the defence of positions, since they were not able to contain the fascist counterattacks. This will be a constant during the whole development of the war.

<P>After both battles that jointly form part of the campaign for the defence of Madrid, the fascists abandoned momentarily the plan of seizing directly the capital and orientated their main forces towards the conquest of the republican North strip, culminating it on 20th October 1937.

<P>The loss of the North was a harsh politic, military, economic and moral blow for the Republic that made reaction and imperialism believe in an immediate victory. They will be soon surprised. By the end of the year the republican army started an audacious offensive in the Arag&oacute;n front with the aim of preventing a possible enemy attack against Madrid and to seize Teruel. On 8th January 1938 the people's forces, after having besieged the city of Teruel, achieved the surrender of the troops that defended it.

<P>From a military point of view, the operation was a success. <EM>If Madrid, in the context of the Spanish war, meant the defence of the Republic </EM>-general V. Rojo affirmed-<EM>, Teruel constitutes the first great offensive deed of its army where it becomes able to carry out a complete military manoeuvre, being enough seven days of attack to surrender a pocket of one thousand square kilometres, sixteen days to defeat in the heart of the city a resistance maintained fiercely and tenaciously by its defenders</EM>. And he adds: <EM>In Teruel it was not only proved that the war experience had been worthy but the healthy moral that the human factor had acquired in the course of the war became also evident</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n134">(134)</A>.

<P>In fact, those progresses were evident. From the heroic defence of Madrid to the battles of Jarama and Guadalajara, when the regular army began to be organized and to the operations of Brunete and Belchite, till culminating in the big offensive of Teruel, the people's armed forces maintained a line of advance and improvement in all fields. But as it will not take long to be proved by the later withdrawal from Teruel and later on by the rupture of the front of Arag&oacute;n by the fascist divisions -during the defensive battle of Levante- and by the defeat of the republican offensive attempt in river Ebro and by the quick fascist advance over Catalonia, those progresses became annulled by the overwhelming military superiority of the enemy.

<H3><A NAME="c62"></A>6.2. The coup of Casado</H3>

The setbacks and military defeats of the Republic aggravated the contradictions within the People's Front making them antagonist. And this because they sharpened the tendency of the democratic bourgeoisie towards compromise and surrender to the financial-landowning oligarchy with which, in spite of their divergencies and politic and economic rivalries, shared the same class interests and objectives and the same fear of a development of the revolution under the leadership of the proletariat. However, given the terms in which the confrontation with reaction was posed, the working and people's masses -as we have already pointed out- could only safeguard their conquests and fully satisfy their democratic vindications and those of a better life with the complete defeat of fascism and with the consolidation of a regime of new democracy that would grant the bases for the establishment of socialism. With these objectives, as it is logical, the republican bourgeoisie could not agree.

<P>In this way, after the division of the republican territory in two as a consequence of the arrival of the fascist army to the coasts of Levante, the capitulationist tendencies started to strengthen within the People's Front and the Government. From democratico-bourgeois leaders as Aza&ntilde;a to prominent socialdemocrat leaders and military commanders without forgetting the members of the FAI, all of them exerted pressure to end with the war through a <EM>compromise</EM> with the so-called government of Burgos and got ready to form an opposition bloc against the communists, their main obstacle to carry out their capitulationist plans and manoeuvres.

<P>Those manoeuvres, to which the English and French diplomacy were not alien, were unmasked and combated by the Party appealing and resorting to the masses. As Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az -who was each time more separated from the leadership tasks due to his illness- pointed out, such a <EM>compromise</EM> <EM>would be a surrender </EM>[...]<EM> it would mean the loss of the war</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n135">(135)</A>. <EM>There cannot be peace </EM>-he added-<EM> till all the enemies and all who try to establish in Spain a fascist regime are crushed</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n136">(136)</A>.

<P>In Barcelona -seat of the government at that moment- the PCE and the PSUC, counting with the support of different non-communist politic and syndical sectors, convoked a big mass demonstration in support of the policy of resistance in order to press the government; to which the workers massively attended without any distinction of trends. At the same time they made a call to the army, in which most of its officers and combatants pronounced in a plebiscite in favour of continuing the struggle <A HREF="apronot.htm#n137">(137)</A>.

<P>In view of this clear people's will and of the communist pressure, the capitulationists temporarily withdrew although they continued with their labour of sabotage.

<P>However, with the unstoppable fascist advance over Catalonia and the hardening of the English and French positions against the Republic after the Munich pact, demoralization started to exert its influence on those who, like Negr&iacute;n, had always supported, although with hesitations, the policy of resistance advocated by the communists. Negr&iacute;n, instead of fighting the capitulationists and taking energetic measures against them, and specially against the high rank military officers, maintained a conciliatory attitude, paid attention to the English and French mediating proposals and yielded each time more and more to their pressures. This explains the fact that he presented to Parliament a programme like the one of the <EM>Three points of Figueras</EM> to end the war through a <EM>peace without reprisals</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n138">(138)</A>, and that it received the support of Aza&ntilde;a and of those of his sort. But what was more threatening it was that such demoralization and lack of perspectives were also felt in the Leadership of the Party, to the point of giving its support to such a programme <EM>without doubts of any kind</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n139">(139)</A>. A programme which, no matter how many slogans of resistance it launched, was nothing but a cover for capitulation.

<P>In view of that capitulationist attitude and of clear submission of the Leadership of the Party to Negr&iacute;n's Government, it is easy to understand that Casado and his fellow-traitors found a field favourable for the intensification of their manoeuvres aimed at ending the war in the shortest time possible. In order to achieve that, they needed to silence the communists, task on which they centred all their efforts in the middle of the offensive of the fascist troops against Catalonia, starting by forgetting the propaganda and the meetings of the Party under the pretext of the military censorship and by arresting in some provinces the communists who called upon the people to continue the struggle. At the same time, the supporters of Casado, who occupied the key posts in the republican army, sabotaged the military operations addressed at facing the enemy offensive.

<P>However, on this occasion, the Leadership of the Party, instead of reacting, mobilizing the militants and denouncing the coup which was being arranged by the rest of the members of the People's Front, submitted almost completely to the Government. <EM>The mistake of the leadership of the Party -as it is admitted in a resolution of the PB posterior to the defeat- laid in the misunderstanding of the fact that even if it was just to help Negr&iacute;n to overcome his hesitations, it should have made its action more independent, orientating itself decidedly towards the masses</EM>. This attitude was not modified, as the very resolution points out, <EM>not even in such serious moments as the ones which preceded the coup of Casado, when the factors of treason matured and were almost public knowledge; when even the majority of the ministers openly pronounced themselves in favour of ending the war and Negr&iacute;n, involved in an atmosphere of treason and falseness, did not take any measure against the traitors and capitulationists. In spite of all, the leadership of the Party still hopes everything from the politic and organizational measures to oppose the imminence of the treason</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n140">(140)</A>. On the contrary, all its attention -as Togliatti confirms in his reports to the CI trying to hide his own responsibility- <EM>was centred mainly on the absolutely necessary struggle for the conquest of the centres of leadership, above all in the army, more than on the labour of strengthening and systematically organizing the links of the Party with the masses</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n141">(141)</A>.

<P>In this way, since it did not act with decision and independence from the Government due to the fear of <EM>breaking the People's Front</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n142">(142)</A>, when the capitulationists already had broken it, the Party isolated itself from the masses and left the bourgeoisie and its socialdemocrats and FAI allies an open field to enter into action.

<P>On 3rd March 1939 the republican Fleet, centred in Cartagena, rebelled against the Government and tried to desert, being this impeded by the communist officers and sailors. The capitulationist elements of the units of the navy base took advantage of this situation to rise up and take control of the city. Afterwards, after raising the fascist flag and asking the enemy to send them reinforcements, ordered the fleet to leave the base and sail into the sea, what could not be avoided since all the militants of the Party in the fleet units were arrested by the supporters of desertion.

<P>The Cartagena insurrection was crushed by the initiative of the leadership of the Party -only time in which it acted energetically and in an independent way- using a brigade formed by communists and mobilizing all the cadres and militants of Murcia and the nearer villages.

<P>Both the rebellion of the Fleet and the pro-fascist uprising of Cartagena were part of Casado's plan which, in agreement with the Head Quarter of the enemy army, consisted on <EM>opening to the fascists the gates of Cartagena and Madrid at the same time</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n143">(143)</A>. But the crushing of the insurrection changed partially the course of the events.

<P>On the night of March 5th, Casado rebelled in Madrid against the Government, constituting a Junta or Defence Council headed by general Miaja, by himself and Juli&aacute;n Besteiro, a prominent socialdemocrat leader. In it there were represented all the parties which integrated the People's Front, except the communists.

<P>The supporters of the coup immediately arrested in Madrid several communist military who occupied prominent posts in the army to hold them as hostages; at the same time the representatives of the Party were everywhere separated from the posts that they occupied in the State machine and expelled from the unitarian organs of the People's Front; the seats of the Party were stormed and hundreds of cadres were arrested to be later on handed out to the fascists.

<P>In order to confound the masses and isolate the Party from them, the Junta covered up the military coup with the spreading of the news that the communists had risen up in Cartagena and that they pretended to carry out a coup d'&eacute;tat, at the same time that they launched on the radio constant proclaims in which they affirmed that they would not leave arms before having guaranteed a <EM>peace without crimes</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n144">(144)</A>. And they said this while they were completing the surrender of the people to the fascist butchers and silencing with the military censorship the passing by the fascist Government of Burgos, on 13th February 1939, of the <EM>Law of political responsibilities</EM> with which it was established the prosecution of all those who from October 1934 had participated in the republican politic life or who from February 1936 had opposed to the <EM>National Movement</EM> through <EM>specific actions or serious passivity</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n145">(145)</A>.

<P>The Party was surprised by the coup of Casado and, apart from Madrid (where it had taken some measures to neutralize quickly a possible coup but which ,when the time came, they were not put into practice) it did not react to crush the Junta <EM>although -as Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az affirms- it counted with the necessary forces</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n146">(146)</A> nor did it mobilize the masses. The leadership of the Party, seeing that the Government did not fulfil its functions and was leaving the country, considered, in accordance with the governmental policy that it had been following, that there was nothing else to do and left its post in the moment in which it was more necessary, leaving Spain the majority of its members a few hours after the fleeing of Negr&iacute;n. For that reason, it is not strange that some prominent leaders who left the country later on -as Checa, Jes&uacute;s Hern&aacute;ndez and others, like the <EM>advisor</EM> Togliatti- tried to make peace with the supporters of Casado and ordered the military forces of the Party, that were about to defeat them, to accept the truce asked by the Junta and to cease fire; what they did in fact <A HREF="apronot.htm#n147">(147)</A>. In this way Casado and those of his sort took advantage of the ceasefire to gain time, to receive reinforcements from the front commanded by socialdemocrat and anarchist officers and to attack and neutralize later on by surprise the communist unities that had confronted them, arresting and shooting some of their commanders while others were reserved to be handed out to Franco as a present.

<P>A few days later, on March 28th, the fascist troops entered Madrid without shooting a single bullet; at the same time, the other fronts left arms thinking that the Junta had achieved some kind of compromise. The <EM>honourable peace</EM> and <EM>without crimes</EM> of Casado, Miaja, Besteiro, Wenceslao Carrillo and Cipriano Mera became in this way the biggest slaughter suffered by the people at the hands of reaction in the history of Spain.

<H3><A NAME="c63"></A>6.3 Under which conditions could resistance have been maintained?</H3>

We cannot deduce from this disastrous end of the war that the politics of the Party and, more specifically, the People's Front tactics were wrong. On the contrary, we have to highlight that without them the people would not have been able to confront the reactionary military forces for three years under such difficult conditions. But the fact that the Party line was essentially just did not immunize it against the mistakes committed in its application, nor could it be alien to the struggle between the two lines that was taking place in its bosom. Anyway, we have to consider if those mistakes were heavier in the balance than its best decisions.

<P>Bearing in mind what we have exposed, it is evident that from the beginning of the war the Party made a series of mistakes both at the politic and military levels that led it to submit each time more to the republican Government; and those mistakes finally became central. In this way, what in the beginning was a just line became its contrary, provoking the debacle of the Party and impeding any organized armed struggle against fascism.

<P>If so many mistakes had not been accumulated, a defeat -which was very probable from the beginning of the war due to the unfavourable correlation of forces and to the international situation, that already at that moment impeded the people to win the war- would not have impeded the continuation of the struggle.

<P>One of those mistakes against which we have advised, that is undoubtedly the most serious one, since it impeded the Party to prepare itself to maintain the resistance under the new conditions, consisted -as it is pointed out in the Programme approved by the III Congress of the PCE(r)- on <EM>tending to abide to the republican Government instead of supporting unity from an independent politic and military position. This led it to neglect the ideological struggle within the People's Front and within the Party and not to pay attention to the politic labour among the peasantry</EM>. <EM>This policy of subordination and of concessions -it continues- although it pointed towards the consolidation of a bourgeois parliamentarian democracy instead of a republic of new type, in practice could only contribute under those circumstances to the victory of fascism</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n148">(148)</A>.

<P>Nothing else happened in the end. Due to that tendency towards subordination, the Party ended losing its politic independence, allowed the republican bourgeoisie to recover its hegemony in the democratic revolution and to stop its development and left in its hands the leadership of the struggle against reaction in front of which it tended to surrender due to its class position. For that same reason, that subordination also led the Party to isolate itself progressively from the masses -specially from the poor peasantry- and to underestimate the role that the latter could play in the development of the democratic revolution and in the struggle against fascism and imperialism.

<P>Likewise, that lack of independence was also reflected in other collateral problems as the one of the colonial question and, more specifically, regarding Morocco. Although the Party defended in its programme the right of the Moroccan people to their self-determination and independence, from the beginning of the war the leadership forgot it completely and became, regarding this issue, an accomplice of the Government, to the point of adopting with regard to the colonial question the typical positions of socialdemocracy, as the one of pretending to <EM>spread democracy to the colonies</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n149">(149)</A>.

<P>However, the fact that in the course of the war a policy of subordination to the republican Government imposed each time more in the Party and first of all in its leadership, does not mean that all its cadres and militants shared it. As can be deduced from the conceptions that orientated its action and from its many times contradictory application, in the bosom of the Party was taking place an open struggle between two lines regarding all the problems of the revolution: a revolutionary line, of resistance and another reformist, of capitulation. Would it have been otherwise and the big majority of the Party would not have followed a revolutionary line, of resistance, there is no doubt that the opportunist tendencies that were flourishing in it would have prevailed before.

<P>If this line of subordination and claudication finally imposed in its leadership, it was due to the fact that the supporters of the line of resistance were not capable nor could avoid it. To this incapability was not alien the influence gained in the Party by the <EM>leftist</EM> positions as a reaction against this opportunist tendency. Hence, in view of the sharpening of the capitulationist manoeuvres of the rest of the members of the People's Front and of their anticommunist positions, to which that line of concessions and subordination followed by the Leadership were giving free reins, many militants did not see any alternative but the seizure of power by the Party. <EM>The tendency against which I have had to pronounce myself many times -writes Togliatti in his report to the leadership of the CI dated on 21st-22nd April 1938- has been the one of believing that the solution to the problems will be possible if the Party takes in its hands all the organs of power and as soon as it does so. Some hesitation, quickly overcome, even in Pepe (Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az), in the form of tending towards a pure worker government</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n150">(150)</A>.

<P>Truly, considering the possibility that the Party seized power, no matter if it would be done under the formula of a worker government, was not a just position since there were no conditions for it and even less to be able to maintain it. However, neither was it just to continue submitting to the democratic bourgeoisie, as Togliatti proposed, basing himself on a false conception of the People's Front, that is to say, on unity without struggle. At that moment, it is true that it was necessary to spread the front of struggle against fascism and not to limit it or, as Mao said by that same time, it was necessary to put into practice a policy of <EM>open doors</EM> and not of <EM>closed</EM> ones. But, without ever renouncing to the politic independence of the Party nor to the ideological struggle since, if this happened, as experience will prove, not only will the People's Front be weakened but the activity of the capitulationists will be made easier. And this is, precisely, although in a mistaken way, what the supporters of the idea that the Party should seize power tried to prevent.

<P>In this sense, it is doubly relevant that the Secretary General of the Party, Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az, showed himself <EM>hesitant</EM>, as Togliatti says, and that he shared in some way the position of the latter ones; this was a sign that he was seeing the blind alley to which the policy of subordination and concessions led without, on the other hand, having a clear idea of what path they should follow. Moreover, if it led to oppose to the <EM>advices</EM> of the leaders of the CI, whose politic and moral authority had a great weight and to break with this dependence when coming to elaborate and apply the politic line. This dependence -together with the fact that the position in favour of the seizure of power by the Party was not a just one- explains to a great extent that incapability of the PCE to adopt a line of its own and Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az' quick <EM>recovering</EM> from his <EM>hesitations</EM>.

<P>It was neither casual that it was in Madrid where that <EM>leftist</EM> position was stronger, as it can be learnt from the references that Togliatti makes in his reports about the existence of <EM>much sectarianism</EM>, more specifically, in <EM>the rank-and-file organizations</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n151">(151)</A>, since it was precisely in Madrid where the capitulationist and anticommunist activity could be better perceived. Neither was it casual that <EM>Mundo Obrero</EM> (<EM>Worker World</EM>, voice of the Party) became the spokesman of this tendency that was not <EM>sectarian</EM> at all, in which, together with mistaken ideas and banners like the one that the Party should seize power, other just ones were defended. Such as the one which called upon the people to base on their own forces and not to wait for the help of the <EM>democratic</EM> capitalist countries in which the majority of the leaders of the Party and the CI trusted, as it is proved by the fact that they tried to propitiate it making them one concession after another. Due to this we can affirm that, in spite of its mistakes, this tendency was the one which truly represented the line of resistance of the Party. Since those <EM>leftist</EM> mistakes could always be corrected. But, on the contrary, the rightist positions were hardly rectifiable -as experience will prove- since what prevailed in them was not in any way a spirit of struggle but of claudication and of surrender to fascism. And this radical difference between the line of resistance and the one of claudication became clearly visible in front of the coup of Casado: while most of the leaders of the Party and other cadres left the struggle or simply, as Carrillo and others after the fall of Catalonia, neglected their responsibilities staying in France, many cadres and local militants -headed by several members of the CC and of the Madrid local leadership- faced the supporters of Casado with the arms in their hands. Some of them even withdrew later on to the mountains to start the guerrilla warfare and continue the struggle.

<H3><A NAME="c64"></A>6.4. Historic necessity of the strategy of Protracted People's War</H3>

The influence of those opportunist politic and ideological positions was what, undoubtedly, led the PCE to renounce to its independence in the military field and what in the end impeded it to appreciate the <EM>necessity of developing a military line of its own, marxist-leninist</EM> and <EM>to understand the laws and characteristics of a people's war</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n152">(152)</A>. If to this we add the Leadership's underestimation of the enemy forces at a general level, which made it think that the war could be won in a relatively short period of time, it is easy to understand that they centred all their efforts on the formation of a regular army and on the carrying out of a conventional war. Under the influence of these and other mistaken ideas, the Leadership did not prepare the Party nor the masses for a Protracted war based on the principle of self-maintenance and underestimated the guerrilla warfare, which was precisely one of the things that most worried the enemy.

<P>Stalin himself insisted on its convenience and advised to <EM>create in the rearguard of the fascist armies groups of guerrilla fighters formed by peasants</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n153">(153)</A>. Following these advices, this necessity was even posed by Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az in the Plenum of the CC in March 1937 <A HREF="apronot.htm#n154">(154)</A>.

<P>There were favourable conditions to carry it out. On the one hand, in the fascist zone there was a numerous poor peasantry and a proletarian population each time more important, above all after the collapse of the northern front, which were submitted to a regime of terror and oppression. On the other hand, many antifascists had looked for shelter in the mountains escaping from repression and in some places they started to organize guerrilla detachments that carried out sabotages and punitive actions against falangists and other elements of the repressive forces. Some of these guerrilla groups, formed by combatants of the people's army who had moved to the mountains with their arms and equipment after the collapse of the Asturian front, had the fascists on the rack since they were not able to end completely with them thanks to the support of the population. This allowed many of these guerrilla groups to keep active till the middle of the 1940s.

<P>The Party should have promoted the guerrilla warfare in view of the unfavourable course of the war, basing itself on an objective appreciation of the conditions under which it developed and of the confronted forces and having into account, as Mao pointed out, both the positive and the negative aspects for both sides, as well as their reciprocal actions <A HREF="apronot.htm#n155">(155)</A>. Moreover after the coup of Casado and the defeat.

<P>Above all, the military superiority of the reactionary forces and the weakness of the people's forces could be modified, as Mao affirms, if <EM>a correct military and politic tactics during the war, without making mistakes of principle</EM> had been applied, and making <EM>all possible efforts</EM>. Only in this way -he adds- <EM>all the factors favourable for us and unfavourable for the enemy will be strengthened as the war becomes protracted, they will modify more and more the initial correlation of forces and will transform the superiority of the enemy over us into superiority of us over him</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n156">(156)</A>.

<P>That correct military tactics under the conditions of Spain at that moment was the guerrilla warfare within a protracted people's war strategy. The guerrilla warfare was what better corresponded to the popular character of the revolution and it counted with a great tradition in our country where during the Independence War against the Napoleonic occupation it played for the first time in world contemporary history a strategic role. And it could have played that same role in the struggle against fascism. The guerrilla action behind the enemy lines not only would have strengthened considerably the military powerfulness of the republican army and the possibilities of resistance, but, in front of the possible capitulation of some sectors of the People's Front or of a defeat, it would have established the foundations to go on with the struggle and would have allowed to win the mountains for thousands of communist cadres and militants and members of other antifascist organizations who, since they stayed in the cities, were captured and killed.

<P>But the adoption of that strategy required from the Party, at the same time, to make a critical balance of the politic and military experience, of the mistakes and the failures, taking specially into account the disastrous consequences to which the policy of <EM>unity without struggle</EM> with the democratic bourgeoisie and with other anarchist or socialdemocrat worker organizations had led it; and, above all, to take into account the betrayal against the people that these organizations had just perpetrated unleashing the coup of Casado and surrendering to fascism.

<P>On the other hand, in order to put into practice the guerrilla war, it was necessary to withdraw to secure and well-protected bases in the mountain zones which counted with appropriate conditions to accumulate, disperse or concentrate forces to attack or to defend themselves from the enemy and to spread the support bases and the guerrilla zones.

<P>Throughout all this initial period the Party should do a clear approach about the role of the armed struggle in the development of the revolution, highlighting that war was the main form of struggle and that the guerrilla army became the main form of organization. The gravity centre of the action of the Party and of the armed forces under its command had, consequently, to be moved from the cities to the countryside and to the mountains in order to be able to carry out from there the siege of the cities before passing to their seizure. This does not mean that no more attention should be paid to the clandestine organization of the Party in the urban areas nor to other forms of struggle and organization of the workers, nor that it would not be necessary to pay attention to the development of the urban guerrilla warfare. But those forms or methods of struggle and organization, under those conditions, could not play but a secondary role.

<P>At the same time, in view of the foreseeable situation of inter-imperialist confrontation that was going to take place in the international field, the people's forces should not dismiss the accumulated experiences about the attitude shown by the <EM>democratic</EM> powers towards fascism in general and towards Spanish reaction in particular. Anyway, independently of the possibility of using for its advantage the contradictions among the imperialists, the Party should lean on its own forces and not depend on the international support in order to secure the victory.

<P>In the final stage of the people's war or even before, the small guerrilla units will be able to become gradually strong columns and regular units, with the objective of turning the guerrilla war into a war of movements, forcing the enemy to leave the defence of positions, in which the guerrilla always finds more obstacles to defeat a well-equipped enemy and to resort mainly to manoeuvres.

<P>As Mao observes, that transformation does not have to entail the abandonment of the guerrilla activity, but <EM>the gradual formation, in the course of the ample development of the guerrilla war, of a main force able to carry out the war of movements; a force around which there will have to exist, as before, many guerrilla units to carry out ample guerrilla operations</EM> which, as he said, constituted <EM>powerful wings of the main force</EM> and served as an <EM>inexhaustible reserve for its continuous growth</EM> <A HREF="apronot.htm#n157">(157)</A>.

<P>The changing of the guerrilla war into a war of movements would allow to strike the enemy harshly and to ultimate the conditions to pass to the offensive of the regular and guerrilla forces, combining it with the insurrection in the cities, with the objective of dispersing the enemy army and annihilating it everywhere. That moment could only take place in the final stage of World War II or immediately after its end, when the imperialist forces were not in conditions of coming to help reaction or, at least, they could not do it with the rapidness and the means that such a situation required.

<P>In this way, since the PCE did not make a strategic reconsideration of the politic and military line followed during the war and it did not correct the politic, military and ideological mistakes to which we have referred above, the Party was not only impeded to confront the coup of Casado and to continue the armed resistance against fascism but it also unabled itself to lead the masses later on to the seizure of power. But more serious was the fact that the consequences of those mistakes were deeply felt in the Party later on, to the point of favouring the sabotage task of the carrillists and its posterior liquidation at their hands.
