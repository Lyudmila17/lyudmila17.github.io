TO ALL ANTIFASCIST, ANTI-IMPERIALISTS AND ANTICAPITALISTS ORGANIZATIONS, TO ALL THOSE THAT FIGHT AGAINST THIS SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION AND DEATH:</span>
<H1 style="font-size:26">
STOP THE MURDEROUS HAND OF THE TURKISH FASCIST STATE!!

<BR>LET US SAVE THE LIFE OF THE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN DEATH FAST!!</H1>

<H4>Communiqu&eacute; of the political Prisoners of the PCE(r) and GRAPO</H4>

<P>After 165 days of Death Fast, other three Turkish revolutionary prisoners have died, transformed into a bundle of bones, but also transformed into a symbol of the resistance, the will and the dedication to the revolutionary ideals. These three comrades unite to those more than 50 that fell before the fire and the murderous bullets of the army when, on December 19, 20 and 21, they entered in the prisons to put an end to their resistance and to finish with the hunger strike that they had begun on October 20.

<P>The determination of the Turkish comrades of not giving in the face of the slow death that the fascist State had drifted against them, by the torture for the isolation in the F Type prisons, it has impelled them to put on risk its life again. The State, continuing its criminal political of squashing to blood and fire all form of popular resistance, it continues showing its murderous nature, it continues showing that it won't give up in front of the fair claims of the prisoners, it continues showing its arrogance, its security in that he won't lack help of its patterns, all the imperialistic powers, especially USA and the European Union that use Turkey to continue controlling the entire region.

<P>WE CANNOT ALLOW IT! We should not remain passive before so many crimes, and we won't make it. We, the political prisoners of the PCE (r) and of the GRAPO, from the prisons of the Spanish fascist State, we denounce this wild massacre before all the workers and antifascists of the world. And we declare that, from the next April 23, we begin a solidarity HUNGER STRIKE OF, indefinite and rotational. You will begin in the prison of Seville II, and successively they will go raising the strikers all the prisoners of our two organisations in the Spanish State.

<P>Comrades,

<P>May Day is coming, and May Day symbolises the labour struggle for the socialism. We should, on this glorious date, to make that the INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY is more alive than never. We should demonstrate that the PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISM is a guide for the action of all those that fight for the freedom and the socialism. We should become facts the whole rage that produces us the brutality that the capitalists are extending all over the world. We should support with all our forces to the comrades in Death Fast in the Turkish prisons. 

<P>The struggle of our Turkish comrades is not a simple struggle for the improvement of the prison conditions. Their battle is one more than those that get rid every day for the destruction of the capitalism and for the advance toward the freedom and the socialism. They are lifting the flag of the RESISTANCE, the flag of all those that we are subjected to the capitalist barbarism. The enemy that they are combating, the capitalism, the fascism and the imperialism, is our enemy, it is the enemy of all peoples. The repression that falls on them is the same one, and it has the same causes that the one that we all are suffering. The ideal that they are defending, a world without exploiters neither exploited, a free and fair society, is also necessary for us, it also guides all our struggle. For all these reasons they cannot lack our encouragement, we should make them feel our most active solidarity.

<P>In front of the one sought imperialistic "globalisation" and in front of all the intents of dividing the workers and the peoples, let us lift the flag of the Proletarian Internationalism! In front of the constant increase of the repression, in front of the intents of drowning in blood the longings of freedom of the towns, let us increase our Resistance! Strong fight against those enemies of the whole humanity! In front of the "unique thought" that try of imposing, in front of the giving up and the conformity that the imperialists extend among the masses by means of the Fascist terror, let us demonstrate once again that the revolutionary fight is possible! Only with the most resolved fight the masses will reach their objectives!

<P>With our solidarity hunger strike, the political prisoners of the PCE (r) and of the GRAPO are calling to all the antifascists, to all the communists, anarchists, nationalist, to all the true democrats and progressive, to all those that are against the cruelties that are made every day against the workers’ and by all possible means, to the widest solidarity with the Turkish revolutionary prisoners in Death Fast.

<P>On this May Day, we make a call to the unit, to regroup the forces that allow us to create Committees to Support the strikers and to throw a wide campaign of information to denounce, to promote chats, conferences, acts of all type to mobilise the masses. We call to denounce, to attack and to harass the Turkish fascist State and to carry out all type of actions against their interests.

<DIV style="text-align:center;font-weight:900;color:maroon">

<P>LET US DON'T ALLOW THAT THE MASSACRE CONTINUES IN TURKEY!

<P>THE STRUGGLE IN THE PRISONS AND THE STRUGGLE IN THE STREETIS THE SAME STRUGGLE, AS THE STRUGGLE IN TURKEY AND THE STRUGGLE IN SPAIN, IS THE SAME STRUGGLE!

<P>DOWN TO THE CAPITALISM, THE FASCISM AND THE IMPERIALISM!

<P>FOR MAY DAY OF RESISTANCE AND OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY!
