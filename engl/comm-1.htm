<h1>Communique of the Central Committee of the PCE(r)</h1>

<H4>January, 2000</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The I Plenum of the Central Committee elected in the IV Congress of the Communist Party of Spain (reconstituted) has been held. The order of the day has included, among other things, the study of the reports corresponding to the different fields of the Party's activity, the election of the Commissions of the C.C. and the approval of the plans of work for the next period. As a previous question, which was not included in the order of the day, the Plenum has agreed to put an end to the rectification campaign that had started before the holding of the Congress. One of themostimportant conclusions of the evaluation ofthat campaign is that it will still be necessary to develop others in thefuture since onlyin this way, that is to say, <B>on the basis of criticism and self-criticism and the rectification of ourown mistakes</B>, does the Party learn, purge itself and become stronger.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current international situation was analysed in the meeting; we consider that the sharpening of the crisis of capitalism and the struggle among the big powers for a new sharing of the world are favourable factors for the re-launching of the activity of the Party and of the revolutionary movement in general.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Plenum has carefully studied Spain's political and social situation, stating the accurateness of the analysis and predictions made by the leadership of the Party concerning many matters. In particular, it has highlighted the justness of our position as regards the "peace process" in the Basque Country that has been sabotaged by the Government.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A special attention has been paid to the <B>movement ofstrikes and clashes in the streets </B>launched by the proletariat of the shipyards, the mines, RENFE <A HREF="#n*">(*)</a>, etc., at the end of 1999. In these combats fought by the working class the tendency to corner the official trade-unions, as real instruments of the employers and the Government within the companies, has imposed itself; and the independent syndical methods of struggle have opened their way. This <B>resurgence </B>of the working-class movement foresees a new stage in the development of the people's movement and has added a new aggravating element to the political crisis that the regime is undergoing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important question that has been dealt with in this meeting of the C.C. is the one referring to the necessity of systematising and defining more our proposals and political slogans, putting a special emphasis on the fact that in Spain there is no other alternative nor solution to the serious problems and blights created by capitalism than <B>the programme forthe socialist revolution and the political line of resistance </B>that the PCE(r) advocates for and tries to put into practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Plenum has taken the following resolutions:

<DIV STYLE="margin-left:50;margin-right:45">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1st) The Central Committee alerts the people's masses about the accelerated preparations of the big powers in order to trigger a new war at a world scale. The Spanish State is taking an active part in these preparations; it is integrated in the military alliances of imperialism and participates in the blackmails, attacks, impositions and plundering of other countries. Likewise, the Party calls upon the working class and the oppressed peoples to join their forces in order to confront the plundering and the aggressions of the imperialist bandits.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2nd) To carry out a wide and intense campaign of denounce of the regime and its repressive policy, linking it to the organization of the <B>active boycott </B>to its next electoral masquerade. We must create pro-boycott committees or groups in order to organize and carry out all kind of actions of refusal to the electoral farce, to support the workers in struggle, to demand the right of self-determination for the oppressed nationalities, to call for the release of the political prisoners and to denounce the open collaboration of IU <A HREF="#n**">(**)</a> with the fascist State and the trade that they are doing with the workers' votes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3rd) The Party must head and give all kind of support to the workers and their resolute sabotage actions carried out in demand of their social and syndical rights; it must promote the holding of assemblies in the working centres and the election of delegates in them in order to negotiate directly with the employers from a position of force, disregarding the legal norms and the intermediation of the trade-union Mafias.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4th) We call upon the working class of Spain to support the Basque working people in its just struggle for its social and national rights. The <B>regrouping </B>of all the forces interested in combating the fascist and imperialist regime until its overthrowing will only be achieved on the solid basis of the unity of the proletariat of all the nationalities of Spain.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5th) The Plenum of the C.C. encourages all the militants, sympathizers and friends to strengthen the already-existing organizations of the Party and to build new ones in the localities where they do not exist, centring their efforts on the workers and the working youth and persevering. with the political line of resistance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6th) The armed struggle carried out by the guerrilla organizations is legitimate and completely necessary; all the class-conscious workers, the combative youth, as well as the true anti-imperialists and antifascists must support them. In particular, we encouragethe working youth to join the active and organized struggle without hesitation and not to spare any effort in order to end with the capitalist exploitation, with fascism and imperialism.
