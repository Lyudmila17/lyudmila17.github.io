<H1>International appeal</H1>

The French judges are completing the arrangements for the great masquerade that will be held against our Party in Paris. The Spanish fascist regime, counting with the active collaboration of the French vichyist government, pretends with this charade to condemn our Secretary General, Manuel Perez Martinez (Arenas), and other outstanding leaders and militants of the PCE(r). Two fighters of the anti-fascist guerrilla organization GRAPO will also be judged together with them.

<P>Our comrades imprisoned in France are accused of belonging to a &quot;criminal association&quot; involved with &quot;terrorist&quot; acts by the mere fact of <B>providing political and moral support to the armed struggle of resistance</B> that is being developed in Spain since the 1940s. However, <B>this is not a crime</B> but, in Arenas’ words, <I>&quot;a duty for any true democrat and revolutionary, since it is a just and legitimate struggle, a right granted by any democratic constitution: <B>the right of any people of the earth to rise up in arms against tyranny</B>&quot;</I>. In fact, what they want to condemn is our very condition of being a communist Party based on the principles of Marxism-leninism, our socialist Programme and our Politic Line of resistance.

<P>They pretend to condemn the PCE(r) because we defend <B>the need of the independent political organization of the working class</B> -that is to say, not submitted nor controlled by the bourgeoisie and its State- in order to be able to overthrow its power and establish the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat as a previous step to achieve the complete abolition of exploitation and of any oppression exerted by men against men.

<P>They pretend to condemn our Party because we advocate for and practice <B>proletarian internationalism</B>: namely, because we devote ourselves to develop the revolutionary movement and the revolutionary struggle in our country and we support this same process in the rest of countries; because we call upon the <B>unity of all proletarian, exploited and oppressed of the world</B> to confront imperialism and we work to strengthen the bonds of unity with the international communist movement.

<P>They want to condemn the PCE(r) because <B>we oppose the new plundering war</B> triggered by the imperialists in order to proceed to a new sharing of the world; because we denounce and confront the intensive process of fascistization of the monopolistic States; because, consequently, we declare ourselves <B>defeatists</B>, that is to say, because we advocate for and make anything we can to achieve the defeat of our own bourgeoisie and to transform this new imperialist war into a <B>revolutionary civil war</B>.

<P><I>&quot;A specter haunts Europe, the specter of communism&quot;</I>, these are the first words of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; written by Marx and Engels. Now well, in spite of the repeated attempts to end with it, in spite of giving him up for dead and buried after the restoration of capitalism in the former USSR and other Eastern European countries, this <I>specter</I> is rising again, this time much more experienced and strengthened after having learned and accumulated important experiences in the struggle against revisionism, trostskysm, reformism and any kind of opportunism. The PCE(r) belongs to this <I>communist specter</I> that threats, today more than ever, the foundations of imperialism. For that reason, the Spanish fascists have been trying to annihilate it for more than 25 years; for that same reason, they –together with their French accomplices- will try to do it again with the Paris trial.

<P>Therefore, to defend today the PCE(r) means to defend the <B>right of resistance</B> of the peoples against fascism and imperialism, whose terrorist and militarist policy does not know any boundaries; it means to defend the right of the international working-class movement <B>to organize itself out of and against the bourgeoisie</B>, to count with its own communist, proletarian and revolutionary party, capable of leading it to the achievement of its historic objectives. In the politic figure of our Party the whole of the international communist movement is also being tried; <B>the practice of proletarian internationalism</B> is being tried. If our comrades are condemned, if our Party is condemned, the European fascist States will have their hands free to make the same thing with other communist, revolutionary and anti-fascist parties and organizations, with the organizations of solidarity with the political prisoners, with the workers that -anywhere in the world- take the streets to reclaim their<B> </B>rights, with the oppressed peoples that rise up against exploitation and oppression.

<P>For all these reasons we call upon all the revolutionary and anti-fascist organizations, all democrat and progressive people, specially the French proletariat and the French progressive, revolutionary and communist movement, to show their solidarity with the PCE(r). We have to denounce the trial-farce that is being arranged, to organize talks and acts in support of the &quot;Paris seven&quot;, to send letters to the court that is going to judge them reclaiming their release, to be ready to testify as witnesses of the justness of their ideas… and to be present the day of the trial at La Cit&eacute; to show that they are not alone, that they belong to the international communist and revolutionary movement.
