<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A thousand Turkish political prisoners, militants of the Communist organisations DHKP-C, TKP(ML) and TKIP, have been on hunger strike since October 20th. Of them, 137 are firmly committed to carry on until the end. Victory or Death! And 100 others, in the next few days, will join them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The harsh reality, which the Turkish revolutionary prisoners confront every day, is that of the massacres which have sadly already been carried out in the prisons of Buca, Umraniye and Uluncalar, where in 1995, 1996 and 1999 17 political prisoners were assassinated; the harsh reality of continual assault on their Communes with bulldozers and live fire, resulting in a long and interminable trail of deaths, injuries, mutilations and disappearances; the harsh reality of the restrictions which turn the prisoners right to defence into a grotesque joke, and above all the construction of modern Extermination Centres, built in the image and style of the European prisons, where the State is aiming to disperse the prisoners and submit them to barbarous isolation in order to annihilate them at a slow pace, in silence and without any scandal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This criminal policy of extermination, which has left the Turkish comrades with no option except to place their own lives on the line in order to defend their dignity as human beings and as revolutionaries, just as they were obliged to do in 1996 with another death fast in which 12 heroic combatants lost their lives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This savage onslaught against the political prisoners is the consequence of the failure of the scorched earth policy which the State has pursued against the Kurdish people, with cities being bombarded and reduced to rubble, with villages devastated and wiped off the map, with some 40,000 dead and 4 million deported, and the failure of the strategy of death squads, dirty war and State terrorism, of assassinations, of disappearances, of large scale torture, of massacres and genocide which they have been implementing against the resistance of the Turkish people. This failure finds is clearest expression in the existence of 10,000 political prisoners.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why, in desperation, they are trying to put an end to the resistance of the political prisoners, using all the measures within their reach, in the vain hope that this will allow them to contain the powerful advance of the revolutionary movement which is developing in the country within Europe where the working class has reached the highest level of consciousness and where the struggle for national liberation and for socialism is embraced by a broad and vast mass movement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the Turkish state would not be able to emulate and even surpass Hitler, Mussolini and Franco together, if it did not count on the acquiescence and unconditional support of the United States and the European powers. The fascist Turkish state and imperialism share the same objective: to isolate, neutralise and annihilate the Turkish revolutionary movement, in any way they can and using any methods, because the development and the advance of this movement not only puts the interests of the Turkish oligarchy in danger, but also the example of its struggle will eventually spread to the peoples of Europe and the Middle East, putting imperialism's most vital interests in danger.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefor, the epic and heroic struggle which our comrades and brothers, the prisoners in Turkey are carrying out, cannot be separated from the struggle against capitalism and imperialism, from the struggle against fascism and for the liberation of the proletariat, which compels and obliges us to take up the most militant and combative solidarity with them. The struggle of the Turkish revolutionary prisoners is exactly the same struggle as that of the revolutionaries imprisoned in the dungeons in Europe, in Peru, In Israel, in Indonesia or any other part of the planet. It is a struggle for:

<P style="margin-left:60;margin-right:45;color:red"><img src="../dibu/boton-4.gif" width=13 height=13>&nbsp;An end to the prisons of extermination, the regime of isolation, torture and humiliation
<BR><img src="../dibu/boton-4.gif" width=13 height=13>&nbsp;The re-unification of the political prisoners and respect for their ideological identity
<BR><img src="../dibu/boton-4.gif" width=13 height=13>&nbsp;The release of the political prisoners who are seriously ill
<BR><img src="../dibu/boton-4.gif" width=13 height=13>&nbsp;The release of all political prisoners who have served their sentence

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And because the hour has arrived when it is necessary to pass from words to deeds, to make proletarian internationalism a loaded weapon of the future, to convert solidarity into a cry which will nourish the struggle of the peoples against the barbarity of imperialism and fascism, we political prisoners from all over Europe who form part of the "June 19th Platform", will carry out a hunger strike, for the first time in a united and joint way, from the 20th to the 27th of this month, in solidarity and support for the heroic struggle which our brothers are engaged in the Turkish jails.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With this hunger strike, we the undersigned call on all revolutionaries, on communists, on anarchists, on nationalists, on genuine democrats and progressives and on anyone who retains an ounce of integrity and dignity, to demonstrate, in whatever way possible and using all the means at their disposal, the broadest possible solidarity with the hunger strike of the Turkish political prisoners. And we also issue a call for Unity and for the regroupment of forces which, putting aside difference and ideological divisions, will permit the creation of Support Committees which will carry out a massive campaign of information and denunciation, which will organise talks, conferences, concerts, which will set in motion mobilisations and all kinds of actions against Turkish interests.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is urgent that we set ourselves in motion as soon as possible! Because the Turkish state has already replied that it will not implement even the slightest concession to the political prisoners and that it is going to use forced feeding in order to try to drown this struggle with a form of torture which involved endless agony, although in order to do this they will have to launch an attack on the prisons and the Communes, massacring the hunger strikers.


<P style="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;color:red">Everyone against isolation, torture and extermination in the Turkish prisons!
<BR>Attacks against Turkish revolutionaries are attacks against the whole workers and revolutionary movement of Europe!
<BR>In order to end fascism in Turkey, we have to fight against imperialism which is sustaining it!
<BR>Forward to international proletarian unity, solidarity and struggle!
