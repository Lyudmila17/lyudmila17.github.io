<H1>Contribution by the Commission for a Red Aid International</H1>

<P>Every year different organizations and collectives interested in building up a Red Aid International meet in Basel with the purpose of together getting closer to achieving that goal.</P>

<P>In November of last year 17 collectives and organizations from seven countries, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Turkey and Switzerland met for the second time.</P>

<P>This demand has from the start the political platform of the Commission for a RAI and must develop step by step in practice. The obvious differences must be taken into account concerning political culture, functionality, degree of organization and the stage of development of the revolutionary, class struggle and anti-imperialist movement. Not necessarily an easy task, but one that expresses the objective political situation with its conditions.</P>

<P>We can only continue to develop and structure international solidarity by using these differences as a mirror for the societal-political situation, accepting them in a productive sense and in a form of a dialectic process, as a part of the international revolutionary movement, to move forward.</P>

<P>To give you a concrete insight we have summarized five points which arose from the last conference in November:</P>

<P>1) In which field should the RAI be active?</P>

<P>Should it confine itself to the revolutionary support of political prisoners engaged in class struggle or should it broaden itself to being active in certain social concerns? There are situations in-between both extremes such as the question of the Sans-papiers or that of the politicized social prisoners. The discussion-basis is made up of the Platform for a RAI which calls for the support of any resistance to repression against the class struggle (such as strikes) and not only the support of political prisoners and their struggles.</P>

<P>2) What should be the relationship between RAI and the non-revolutionary <EM>left</EM>?</P>

<P>Here we have a choice between cooperation and struggle to control our own decisions. How for example should RAI react to so-called personalities or currents of the ruling social democratic left in imperialist Europe? Should cooperation arise under certain circumstances or should any cooperation with the ruling parties be principally turned down?</P>

<P>3) What should be RAI&rsquo;s position concerning the differences between political and ideological analysis between different revolutionaries?</P>

<P>RAI can not decide on the correctness or weaknesses of different positions and this should not be a topic in RAI. RAI however should come up with a code of conduct so revolutionary and militant solidarity does not become a battlefield used to fight over existing differences. We view debates on questions concerning the revolutionary left as essential. However if RAI becomes a battlefield for these arguments, no productive and needed development will be able to be found.</P>
