Dear comrade Jose, a chara,
 
<P>Today in spite of the distance between us, we have never felt as close
as we do today, on the day you attain your freedom once again.

<P>The comrades of the Irish Republican Socialist Party with your own comrades today to welcome you home, to celebrate your release after 17 years imprisonment, and to celebrate the the victory you have claimed for all those who struggle for the interests of the working class through your
release today.
 
<P>A victory we say, because in spite of the fascist crimes, dispersion, torture, imprisonment, and other hardships imposed upon you by the
Spanish State and their imperialist allies, your resistance, courage and
commitment to the revolutionary struggle for socialism serves to strengthen the resolve of all those who share the cause of socialist revolution with you.

<P>Your example provides  hope and strength to all working people to
contend with the adversity they encounter in their own workplace, homeland, municipality, or other place where they must make their own stand.
 
<p>To resist is to win! You, like our own comrades and other
revolutionaries around the globe, model the determination of a revolutionary socialist not merely through words, but through the example of your life as you live it each day, so that others can aspire towards the same.
 
<p>The members of the IRSP hail your release and join with your comrades, GRAPO and the PCE(r), family, friends and loved ones in embracing you as
a brother and a comrade.
 
<p>Now and always, you can rely on the solidarity of the IRSP, because ours is  a revolutionary alliance. Your struggle is our struggle. when you suffer,  we cry. When you achieve victory, we feel the rush of freedom's air in our breasts. Today, because of your release, we are that much freer. Welcome  home to the embrace of the working class, who will always remember the sacrifice you endured for them.

<h5>Long Live the Revolutionary Struggles of the Irish and Spanish Working
 People!
 
<br>Long Live the Solidarity Between our Two Peoples!
 
<BR>Long Live Comrades Such as Jose Balmon Castells!</h5>
 
<h4>Irish Republican Socialist Party, International Department
<br>13 December 2001</h4>
