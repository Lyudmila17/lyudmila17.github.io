<H1>The Continuation of the French Show Trials:
<BR>The Shape of Things To Come</H1>

It has been three years now since the start of the Euro-repressive campaign of November 2002 paving the way for the arrest and imprisonment in France and Spain of about twenty communists, antifascists and supporters of political prisoners. As Communist Party of Spain (reconstituted) PCE(r) activists, and for their part, of the committees for an International Red Aid (SRI) or of the Association of Family &amp; Friends of Political Prisoners (AFAPP), they are to be prosecuted in the judicial proceedings (36/02-M) along with five October 1st Anti Fascist Resistance Group (GRAPO) guerrillas.

<P>The current situation as it stands is that twelve activists are already being held in prison without a fixed trail date for a trail being issued by the French National Court. It is said that along with other exceptional measures, their <EM>preventive detention</EM> will be extended up to four years.

<P>Each of those being held are of the firm opinion that the sentences against them has already been decided in advance in accordance with the new repressive European laws simply because of their ideology and political activities on social and worker issues, and as part of the anti-repressive movement against the ongoing imperialist war.

<P>Accordingly, the reason why they have been condemned is due to the workers right to organise their own party and struggle for true democratic freedom and socialism.

<P>These detentions, just as the previous detentions of November 2000 against the leadership of PCE(r), took place within the framework of a media campaign and were described as a dismemberment of the GRAPO. However, only seven out of some thirty people arrested between 2000 and 2002 during different repressive operations belonged to that armed organisation. Also, their detentions were purposely carried out together with members of the party exclusively as an excuse for justifying the subsequent illegalisation of PCE(r) and its surroundings. After such a criminalising campaign, that again fell into complete oblivion. This is a strategy we know exceedingly well for it had accompanied the Spanish communists activity for three decades: what is not published in the disinformation media does not exist. 

<P>Almost two and a half years later the notorious <EM>Judge Garz&oacute;n</EM> prepared this case for trial: thousands of papers with false evidence and witnesses were manufactured by the police (Guardia Civil). They discussed the contents of these documents and publications and created non-existent organic links with other antifascist organisations, etc. 

<P>In spite of this, the trial was lacking in evidence: the famous armed guard PCE(r) - GRAPO was born thanks to Garz&oacute;n's work and will. None of the colleagues of the National Court had dared to create such a connection between a political party and an armed organisation. As a result, during thirty years of sentences against PCE(r) and its activists, many of them were convicted of illicit association and illegal propaganda.

<P>In brief, this trial is a jumble which aims at hiding the fact that the chief objective of such a political-judicial sham is the criminalisation of PCE(r). As a consequence, the illegalisation of PCE(r) was enforced in March 2003 according to the <EM>Law of Parties in Spain</EM>.
